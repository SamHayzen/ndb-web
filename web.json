The state in power wishes to keep its population constant, as evidenced by its [!2 policies on immigration and population control.] Armalai's surface, while naturally barren, is very colorful; typically a collage of reds, oranges, yellows and blues. The city lights of buildings typically consist of the same vibrant colors, brightly visible from orbit, making the planet seem to sparkle when viewed from the dark side. In recent years, a few bodies of water have started to appear in low lying areas due to the atmospheric conditioning of the planet over the decades of its inhabitance.\n\n    To decrease the spread of foreign pathogens, and to allow for more efficient record keeping of transactions, foreign spacecraft are only allowed to land in specified areas. These areas are treated as buffer zones, and require proper documentation and [!3 clearance] to leave and enter primary Armalite lands. Capital Square in the capital city, [!4 Lightfire], is a special landing area, used only by very important landing vehicles (such as those of national leaders) and only in specific time frames.\u0000css\n    Armalai has made a reputation for itself as being a prominent source of consumer media of all varieties. Combined, the Armalite industries have a disproportional market share when in comes to consumer media. This is accredited to the planet's swift adoption of [!5 Unil], as most creative material from Armalai is written or produced in the galactic language.\n\n    The Armalite [!6 Time Table String] is \"R-0:00T ZT 1Y/9L/37D/4W/10T/100d\". Armalai's local time system is heavily based on that of its orbital parent, La'Foy, as it was established when Armalai was still a La'foyan colony. But, because Unil has been a popular language on Armalai since its introduction, the Unil names for units of local time were quickly adopted by the population and were officially standardized in the year 89.\n\n    Notably, all tapwater found on Armalai contains a standard dose of [!7 Ferilin] for population control.\u0000css\nThere are three classifications for areas on Armalai:\n      \n    Primary areas:\n        These areas are the entertainment focus on Armalai. They contain things like restaurants, theatres, salons, spas, museums, gift shops and other convenient outlets that tourists would need. Primary areas are typically very stylized and visually appealing.  There are sometimes citizen apparel guidelines for while they are in these areas, though they are not mandatory.  Primary areas are littered with discretely placed humidifiers to keep the air comfortably breathable, as opposed to Armalai's typically-waterless atmosphere.\n    \n    Secondary areas: \n        Secondary areas, informally known as “backstage”, are typically reserved for low rank civilian housing, goods manufacturing, and citizen amenities, such as grocery outlets, doctors' offices, studios, etc. There is a clear distinction between primary, and secondary areas; secondary areas have a severely decreased focus on aesthetics. Secondary areas are by no means unappealing, they are simply appear as any other urban area. There is no regulation on passage between primary and secondary areas, though it is difficult without knowing an area layout; many city planners design roads and zones in a way to silently guide people who aren't intended to visit secondary areas (ex: tourists, news crews, etc.) to stay in Primary ones.\n        \n    Wilderness:\n        Wilderness covers the majority of the body's surface, and consists of dunes, what little farmland Armalai has, and some small bodies of water. For some more developed cities, such as Lightfire, there are short, snugly-fit walls between wilderness and developed areas with doors at regular intervals. There are many potential reasons as to why the walls are built; some say that living next to the open desert can make citizens uncomfortable, the walls make the inside of the city slightly cooler, or that they're simply more aesthetically appealing.",

Communities are usually built around natural resources, such as water, forests, or valuable minerals.

Many communities have been observed to be maintaining order and upholding (community-defined) laws. But, these communities prefer to separate themselves from other communities. This combined with their inability to launch ships has led to major isolation.\n\n   Communities have been largely peaceful with one another. This is mainly due to Urra confiscating civilian weapons. But one growing faction, the Grey Styx, has raided the weapons out of many old Urran military bases in the area around the planet's old capitol. The group is believed to have control over at least 50 communities, with no known central headquarters.",

Said busses can usually be used by civilians upon paying a small fee and run in the [!3 Transport Circuit, Supply Circuit, or Homeworld Circuit].\n\n   Privately owned Warp Ferries commonly charge a moderate amount for use, but can boast shorter, more specific circuits for cargo and the likes.\n\n   Warp Ferries were conceptualized by the [!4 GUN] as a solution to the growing demand for transportation between planets which were vast distances apart, with warp cores being unthinkably costly for a civilian even then. So, Warp Ferries were proposed shortly after the creation of the GUN by the nation that was then known as Ghilly as a cost-effective plan for transportation.\n\n   Warp Ferries work by hosting a great number of docking ports of all types for ships to connect to. On these ports, only the connection is functional, meaning that docked ships cannot share power, fuel or passengers with the ferry. Once the ship is ready to depart, it warps to the next [!5 astroport] on its circuit, charging a small fee to each boarded ship for each jump made.",

The back of the torso opened “like a book”, with two vertical panels opening outward. Both the legs opened in tandem with above panels. The armor was opened via a lever just below the back of the neck Drivers were intended to first reach their arms into the torso and slide them into the arms of the armor, also moving their head into the attached helmet. The driver would then step into the legs to fully dawn the armor. Once the driver was inside, the armor would power on, activating the actuators and allowing the driver to move with the assistance of the actuators. The armor would be closed either by an exterior assistant, or by the driver jutting their arms back to physically shut the doors. A design flaw in Mk. 2 power armor is that drivers found it very difficult to reach the lever on the back to open the power armor themselves, often requiring assistance from someone else.\n\n   The Mk. 2 is where power armor adopted its “bulky” aesthetic, being the apparent thickness modern power armor is today. The surfaces and plates on this version of power armor are smooth and rounded.\n\n   The battery on these suits could last though up to 46 hours of use, being a small improvement over its predecessor.",

This theorizes that the universe naturally guides life towards a specific form as is simply the nature of things. Whether it's due to life only being able to exist in this form, or the influence of a greater power is debated. This difference, while both still being part of the Naturalist Origin view, has caused a divide in its believers.\n\nInterventionalism \n     The most divine of the three and by far the eldest, Interventionalists are typically from many religious denominations, despite their personal disagreements about the true origin of the world, they all agree that the world was made in image of a higher being that wished for the world to be so.

On this side, the temperature is lower than the average for the planet, the middle most part of it being in a state of eternal winter, giving Itascus a \"third ice cap\".

GOS replaces T-DOS's Command Line Interface with a universal Graphical User Interface. A system running GOS would first have to boot into T-DOS2, and then run GOS as an executable, letting it run code on the [!1 Mother Processor].\n\n    The operating system required a minimum of 256KiB of free disk space. This is because in the system's use of cooperative multitasking, it would store running programs that aren't currently being processed to disk. GOS could run programs for T-DOS2 by displaying them in a Command Line window, acting the same they did in T-DOS2. GOS also ran special made programs written in [!2 Machina] that had a Graphical Interface. GOS could not run programs for the original T-DOS because they required running code on the Mother Processor, which GOS could not do without.\n\n    While its framework, T-DOS2 can boot without slave processors, GOS will refuse to start (Returning \"!Error 2\\n?Slave processor missing\") if it cannot detect at least one slave processor it can use to run applications.\n    \n    At the peak of its use, GOS was commonly agreed to be the most User-Friendly operating system ever. This was due to its graphical output and mouse-and-keyboard input being much easier to understand by technologically-illiterate users.",

It allows for 8-bit color on any part of the screen, though a color monitor is required. CGOS is capable of running any program that's able to run on GOS, but GCOS programs are unable to run on GOS. In 96PW, a group of hackers made a program called [!1 Colorblind] which allowed CGOS programs to be run on GOS.\n    \n    CGOS was reported to be slower than GOS. This is thought to have been due to the extra stress of producing full-color program windows. CGOS had less WorkRAM available to programs because of the extra memory the OS itself takes up, meaning that more time had to be spent moving running program data to and from memory and the disk more often.\n    \n    Despite its drawbacks, CGOS was still a popular operating system to the public. Color monitors and color programs were seen as a luxury across the galaxy. Promotional material for GCOS heavily used rainbows and vibrant colors in their imagery, depicting hypothetical consumers practically blown away by the spectrums produced by their computer's operating system.",

The Uudilian skies are mostly clear of clouds; a majority of the water on the planet is frozen in scattered ice sheets.\n     \n     Due to the placement of ice in low, level areas, Uudil is thought to have once had small oceans on its surface millions of years ago. Now, the oceans are deep, comparatively flat ice sheets.\n\n     Uudil was initially a colonization project of the [!1 Itascan] government in 38PW. Itascus sent many warp-capable ships with many kinds of Itascan fauna. No Itascan plant species was able to take to the cold, thin atmosphere of Uudil. The project was abandoned. Later, in 42PW, a private [!2 Galleat] organization brought Galleat fauna to the red planet. They took almost immediately. The fauna spread over the planet like mold on a bun. Due to Galleat fauna's dark coloration, the planet's albedo decreased by over 40% just under two years. This caused a massive heating that killed off most of the plant life. Eventually, the planet settled at a stable temperature, with a stable amount of plant life. Now, the average landscape is the planet's natural deep red, with the occasional grey fern or tuft of grass on the ground.\n\n     Due to its poor atmosphere, many people on the surface commonly have to wear [!3 respirators] of some kind, having a low oxygen content in the air.",

Most public indoor areas have [!3 Atmosphere Conditioners] to boost the Oxygen content of the air inside.\u0000css\n    Due to the combination of Ghilly's low gravity, frequent earthquakes, and high metal richness, its architecture has taken on a unique style. Most structures are made of primarily iron and steel. Most small/medium structures are suspended between one to even ten or more meters above the ground. Greater heights are more common in more densely developed areas, with some buildings even suspended above others. Buildings are typically suspended by metal spring bar tubes, or other types of suspension from the ground. Most buildings have access stairs or ramps for easy access. Most ramps are from the ground to the base of the building, though for some very tall structures, they're connected between the base and other buildings or common catwalks.\n     \n     Ghilly's [!4 Time Table String] is as follows: \"N-8:00T ZW 1Y/16L/32D/4W/4T/24d/24p\". Ghilly's local time system is almost entirely based on that of Deoria, with the only discrepancy being the number of days in a lunen. Since Ghilly is a lunar world, orbiting another planet, its time system's year is not based on its orbital period. Instead, it's based off the orbital period of its parent, Deoria.",

Typical applications include removing allergens or dust particles from, or adding oxygen to the air of a closed space.

Some AtCs also have an inside-facing air intake, allowing them to filter unwanted substances out of the room as well. Because of this, Atmosphere Conditioners require their back ends to be exposed to the ambient atmosphere of a planet, and their front ends enclosed in the indoor space they're conditioning.\n\n     To function, AtCs do not require the indoor area to be airtight, though less air openings in the space to make the system more efficient.\n\n     Atmosphere Conditioners are open-system appliances.

The surface is almost completely comprised of dense forest, except for the planet's handful of great plains and cities. From space, Bius Tu is a ball of grainy green, with clusters of dense city lights scattered mainly around the equator. Bius Tu does have many large bodies of water spanning the surface, but they are not visible from space due to even the waters of the planet being lush with large trees adapted to watery environments growing from the seabed. \n\n     Most metropolitan areas on Bius Tu are a notable contrast to the adjacent wooded areas. The Tuine population on the surface is more concentrated in cities than the inhabitants of most planets. This is thought to be due to the difficulty of traversing most of Bius Tu's landscape. Most small homes and structures on the planet are constructed out of lumber; these structures need to be maintained regularly, as Bius Tu's [!2 vivosphere] has a remarkably-high concentration of wood-eating microbes.\n\n     Bius Tu used to also be the home of the [!3 Dark Tuines], but this Tuine subrace has all but been eradicated in the [!4 Greater Tuine Subrace War].",

MoTran was designed with a microkernel in order to devote the most processing time to hardware drivers.\n\n     MoTran's main use has been in appliances, heavy machinery, craft guidance, or other scenarios that require data processing, but not necessarily a refined user-interface.\n\n     MoTran was originally conceived in -16 under the same name as a data-driven solution to controlling an automatic robotic arm. Datec realized that the data system had a more broad potential for hardware management. In the same year, Datec released a version of MoTran with support for modular drivers.\n\n     Drivers for MoTran are made with standardized input-output hooks that allow for better scheduling.

The IASO is run by veterans of multiple branches of the Itascan military, and was intended to help veterans become active in their community by assisting them with getting jobs, housing, and transportation. The IASO reaches out to local businesses and helps staff the businesses with veterans that have skill sets that compliment the position they will fill, and, unlike private staffing companies, the IASO does not charge the businesses for staffing services. \n\n     The IASO also contacts local mass transit agencies to provide passes for veterans that cannot afford them for a reduced fee, and Veteran Passes are to be for veterans only. The IASO also works with local real estate agencies to assist veterans in negotiating a reduced price for their new homes. \n\n     At the time of its creation, the IASO received 5 million Itascan Coins from the Itascan government. However, they were advised that they should consider hosting public events such as barbecues, bingo nights, or movie nights to raise funds of their own, as they will not be issued another grant from the government. The IASO has offices in most every major city, and many large towns on Itascus. The IASO also has an office aboard the [!1 Excelsior.] IASO accepts donations from the general public. Those who submit a donation of $20 of more will receive a handwritten letter from a veteran thanking the donor for their generosity. \n\n     The IASO prints a monthly magazine for those that have bought the monthly donation package, “The Itascan Serviceman”, as it's called, includes war stories, tips from veterans, battlefield breakdowns, a centerfold with upcoming events at their local IASO office, and the latest in (publicly available) military technology, among other war-related media. The organization follows typical Itascan Conservative values. Their motto is: “By the veterans, For the veterans.”",

Deoria is covered in uniformly textured, light-grey mountain ranges spanning and coiling around the planet along every faultline on the surface. Where there aren't long mountain ranges, there are deep blue trenches full of liquid water separating the planet's continents.\n\n     The planet's surface consists of four notable continents, with a few smaller continental areas nestled between them. The four large continents are Milland, Ricefield, Lumbersweep, and Roothome. The four mega continents are arranged in a sort of spherical tetrahedron, each making contact with the other. \n\n     Deoria is now controlled under a single governmental entity, the [!2 Deorian Government]. In ancient Deorian history (before the year 22), there were three global factions. These factions were Polensend, a nation of 532 Million people inhabiting the Milland continent; the UTR, United Townships of Ricefield, a nation of 685 Million people; and Knollstead, a large nation of 1.26 Billion people inhabiting the continents of Lumbersweep and Roothome. These nations have since unified into the Deoria we know today.\u0000css\n    Even though Deoria has its own [!3 local time] system, many Deorian citizens have been observed to use local time and [!4 Galactic Time] interchangeably in daily life. Deoria's Time Table String is \"N-8:00T ZW 1Y/16L/22D/4W/4T/24d/24p\"\n\n     Deoria, as a planet, has notably seen no conflicts with more than 500,000 combatants. The largest conflict on the planet was the [!5 Battle of Jinsed].",

The firing mechanism is spring-loaded by the bolt. The gun can hold three darts loaded through the top. Rounds begin charging once they enter the chamber (if the safety is off). The weapon has an effective range of ~40 meters in 1G.\n\n    The Stinger's darts are electric capacitors. The tails of the darts have fins to keep them straight during flight. The fronts have pairs of needles, each needle connected to a terminal on the capacitor. The needles are made long and sharp, as they're made to be able to pierce through armor. In some variants of the darts, the needles are made with barbs to keep the darts from falling out of their targets. \n\n    Despite the fact that Stingers are made by various manufacturers, darts are usually uniform in their dimensions to allow for better compatibility. The rear fins are 6cm long, 1mm thick, and usually around 1.5 cm wide. The main body of the dart, the capacitor, is 11cm long. The needles at the end of the dart are usually between 2cm and 6cm long. The dart is 1.75cm in radius. The weapon itself costs $225, while darts individually cost $15.\n\nSpecial Information:\n Darts have 18/20 chance to pierce light armor\n Darts do not damage armor\n Darts have a 14/20 chance to ‘kill' electric targets\n Darts stun organic targets for 3-9 seconds",

La'Foy's botanic features are placed in long streaks along the planet's axis of rotation, meaning forests and wetlands are arranged as if claws of unimaginable scale swept across the land. Geologically, La'Foy is relatively featureless, as its geology is very inactive (compared to most homeworlds). The planet's bodies of water, from its rivers to its oceans, are long and winding.\n\n     La'Foys cities are small but numerous, spread densely across the surface. This, combined with the planet's hazy atmosphere, makes it appear almost sparkly when viewed from the dark side, lights being dispersed across the surface. La'Foy's most populous city is [!1 E'Nera], being the planet's only megacity.\n     \n     Interestingly, La'Foy has the lowest rate of [!2 Unil] literacy by populous out of any planet within the GCP at only 7%. This is believed to be caused by the lack of Unil being taught in the planet's public schools. The root cause of this is thought to be nation's outward isolationist additude towards foriegn worlds.\n     \n     In La'Foy's [!3 local time], most of the units have nonstandard names. This is a direct result of the lack of Unil literacy on the planet. La'Foy's Time Table String is \"R-0:00Tisha ZBosha 1Nong/9Ti'nong/40Raji/10Bosha/10Tisha/100Beysha\" In this string, a 'Nong' is equal to the orbital period of the planet, and a 'Raji' is equal to the rotational period.",

When two spacecraft are docked, each is able to read the other's [!1 Callsign] if the ports are connected to a computer system.\n\n     Berthing is the act if joining to craft together permanently or semi-permanently. Berthing ports are much stronger than docking ports, but are considerably more difficult to decouple. Berthing ports have all the functions of docking ports (resource transfer, crew transfer, etc.). When berthing ports are connected, they are deadlocked, and meant to be welded together from the inside. Berthing ports are androgynous and are used in the construction of space stations or larger craft. Newer berthing ports' interiors have panels that can be removed to bridge the two craft/modules, but older or cheaper ports simply have a section of wall marked to be cut and removed.",

Type-A docking ports are capable of transferring power, fuel, computer networking, and of course, cargo and crew. All variations of Type-A docking ports are 60cm in diameter, and most are non-androgynous. When two Type-A ports are connected, the space between them (within the lips) becomes a buffer zone. Because the all variants' port doors open inward, they will not be able to open if there is significantly lower pressure in the buffer zone. The pressure is equalized using an air valve in the door.\n\n     There are three common variations of Type-A ports:\n          Type-A+, pronounced “Type ‘A' Plus”, or, “Type ‘A' Positive”, is the positive connector variant. Type-A+ docking ports have long probes leading the rim of the docking port, extending 23cm out from the lip. The probe is not integral to docking, it's simply used to assist with alignment. Type-A+ docking ports are able to dock with Type-A- docking ports and are usually found on general spacecraft.\n\n          Type-A-, pronounced “Type ‘A' Minus”, or, “Type ‘A' Negative”, is the negative connector variant. Type-A- docking ports have an inlet for a probe of a Type-A+ docking port in the center. The lip of this inlet extends about 2cm out from the lip of the docking port itself. This is to aid with alignment. Type-A- docking ports are able to dock with Type-A+ and Type-A* docking ports. They are found on [!1 carrier] or [!2 station-class] structures for smaller craft to dock to them.\n\n          Type-A*, pronounced “Type ‘A' Star”, is a special connector variant. The area inside of the lip of the docking port is featureless, sometimes with a viewing port. Type-A* docking ports are designed to be able to dock with Type-A- ports, as well as other Type-A* ports. They were introduced in the year 74 in order to \"make spacecraft docking more universal.\"",

While the core tenets of Disterrestrialism are thought to have originated from somewhere else in the galaxy, there are a large number of Disterrestrial communes having stemmed from GCP worlds. Currently, in the GCP, there are four standing communes with over 10,000 members. Ranked from largest to smallest, they're The Order of Exodus, with ~36,000 members; The Order of Paladins, with ~19,000 members; The Order of Scholars, with ~9,000 members; and The Order of Shipwrights, with ~2,800 members.\n\n     Members of this religion collect in communes or groups of communes called orders. The individual communes within an order are called \"sects\", \"abbeys\", or other names, while the lead commune in an order is called a \"convent\", \"monastery\", \"temple\", or another name based on the branch of Disterrestrialism. Due to their nature, these communes are unable to make all of the resources they require. So, each commune has a trade it masters in order to generate revenue, which is then used to purchase resources they cannot generate themselves.\n\n     The core belief of any branch of Disterrestrialism is some variation of the following: \"Life emerged from the cradling comfort of a planet, giving us the warmth and nutrients to expand and grow. But just as we were destined to leave the obscure depths of our oceans, we are destined to leave the cradles of our atmospheres in pursuit of growth and enlightenment in every species.” Disterrestrialist orders are very rigidly structured and well-organized. To maximize their productivity, they attempt to plan out every aspect of their schedules. This applies to both large-scale projects (such as constructing a ship), and small-scale timeframes (such as daily schedules). Each disterrestrialist in a commune has amounts of time allotted for work, meals, leisure, and sleep in each day.",

These latches can only be disengaged by the port's control unit.\n\n     A type-C docking port has a set of double doors that opens inwardly, like a book. The hatch is unlocked by pulling a lever from the inside, but, thanks to their design, they are unable (very difficult) to open when there is significantly higher pressure on the inside of the craft than the outside (i.e., if an operator tries to open the port from within the pressurized cabin while the craft is in a vacuum). Type-C docking ports usually have small glass viewports on one or both of the doors.\n\n     When two craft are docked using type-c ports, the space between the ports acts as a buffer zone. The buffer zone is within the lips of the docking ports. Initially, the buffer zone is a vacuum. The buffer zone can be filled with air using a valve on the door of the port. Once the buffer zone is adequately pressurized (indicating that the seal is airtight, and therefore safe), the port doors can be opened.\n\n      Type-C docking ports were designed and implemented in 53 by the [!1 ISA].

The ring spins around its axis of rotation when powered. When spinning, the ring and everything in it is subject to an outward centripetal force. This force is an adequate substitute for natural gravity, being able to replicate the same strength and properties.\n\n     The torus of a gravity ring is connected to its center by two or more ‘spokes'. One or two of these spokes is a tunnel passage from a zero-g section of the station to the nonzero-g ring. Gravity rings can be anywhere from 15m to 300m+ in radius, with smaller radii requiring shorter periods of rotation to achieve the same outward acceleration. Due to walking crew, moving cargo, or other redistributions of mass, the COM (Center Of Mass) of the gravity ring may shift away from its axis of rotation. This may cause the structure to wobble or shake, which is very dangerous. To prevent this, modern gravity rings are built with special plumbing systems on the outermost portion of the ring to automatically distribute liquids and align the center of mass with the axis of rotation.\n\n     Gravity rings can be used in place of [!2 Exercise modules], as the constant application of a gravity-like force is an adequate method of mitigating the effects of microgravity atrophy. Though, this is not a cost-effective alternative, as gravity rings can cost many magnitudes more than exercise modules.",

Commonly, kitchenette modules are made with a microwave oven, refridgerator, press-fryer, rehydration gun, micro-g wash basin, and [!1 micro-g dining table].\n\n     The microwave ovens found in these kitchenette are not unlike terrestrial microwaves. The notable difference is, instead of having a rotating platter, these microwaves have a rotating serrated skewer in the middle which cooks are intended to place food items over.\n\n     The refrigerators in these modules are very similar to terrestrial refrigerators, thouogh full of pockets, pouches, and boxes instead of shelves and trays.\n\n     A press-fryer is a cooking appliance used for frying and grilling food in microgravity. The appliance consists of a heated baseplate, four rods with fasteners, and a (sometimes also heated) top plate. The four rods are connected perpendicular to each corner of the baseplate. The top plate is aligned by the four rods and kept in place by the fasteners. When in use, press-fryers are usually draped with a mesh veil to keep most grease particles expelled by the food from floating freely in the cabin.\n\n     A rehydration gun is a simple tool. It is a small device consisting of a button, tube, and needle. When connected to a water outlet, it is stabbed into packs of dehydrated food to rehydrate it.\n\n     Micro-g wash basins are long, semi-enclosed spaces used for washing food or other things. The top of a wash basin holds a low-pressure water nozzle that emits water when objects are held near them. The bottom of the wash basin, which is a water receptacle, generates negative air pressure to keep water droplets from leaving the basin.",

These volcanoes were called ‘the warmth' by ancient Galleats.

Specifically, the craft was designed by the fledgling [!3 Eriian] government in the year 42. As the concept of interplanetary civilization developed in the Sol System, so did a need for interplanetary trade on Erii. The cargo volume of the [!3 Pelican], ~28m^3, had been a bottleneck in shipping resources from, and valuables to [!4 Itascus]. This lead to the design of the Walrus, which, by admission of its designer, being \"more or less just a long Pelican\". Due to the expected weight of added cargo, the Walrus's design has omitted hardware related to takeoff, atmospheric flight, or landing. While this reduces the craft's dry mass, it renders it incapable of landing on the surface of a planet. The Walrus is used primarily for transportation of cargo between [!5 Space Stations].\n\n     Due to its nomadic appeal, never needing (or being able to) make home on a planet, Walrus-model ships have spread across the [!6 GCP],  following the proverbial trade winds.

When viewed from space, it appears as a varied iceball, with many salt oceans still existing on the surface without having frozen due to the salt lowering the freezing point. Icebergs the size of islands can be seen floating in the open ocean, while thin ice over the rest of the ocean surface leaves a distinct look from space. \n\n     Just inside the goldilocks zone of it's small star, the planet has cooled to near total freezing. It's massive salt deposits has allowed portions of it's seas from it's geologically ‘warm'  period to still show through the frost. In an astronomical timescale, its cooling was very recent, only happening within the last million years. Much of the surface is still quite rocky, harboring fewer glaciers than other [!2 Gallean] planets. The permafrost is thin across the planet's equatorial regions, due to the salt within the soil, lowering the freezing point.\n\n     Only relatively recently has the planet started its colonization, having begun in the year 46. It has the smallest population out of any other planet in the Gallean nation. The new terrain has proved strange and fascinating to Gallean colonists. With only 50 years of colonization thus far, the planet has only a few cities, with most of them being small settlements 10,000 residents at most. Though, unlike the typical cities,  the capital city of the planet, Zerania City, has 1.5 million permanent inhabitants. Zerania City holds a substantial amount of political control over the rest of the settlements, and therefore most of the planet.",

        "data": "css\n    The Skyrail is a type of transit system used as public transportation within large cities.  A Skyrail system is a fleet of autonomus and/or manually-driven railcars.  These railcars hang vertically from pairs of rails at least six meters off of the ground.  The rails these cars connect to span vast networks that cover entire inner cities.  The railcars can move up to 50 kilometers per hour (13 meters per second), and combined with their low risk of traffic delays, it makes them a prime choice for commuters desiring to get to somewhere in their city very quickly.\n\n    There are two common types of railcars in Skyrail systems, Personal Cars and Commuter Cars.\n    Personal Cars can be summoned at terminals by individuals, and commonly only have four seats.  Upon boarding a Personal Car, its passenger(s) interact with a computer onboard to select a Skyrail terminal in their city that they would like to be delivered to.  Personal Cars commonly directly cost money, or an intermediate currency made specifically for the system (ex: Skyrail tokens).  This is to offset the cost of maintaining the system.  Personal Cars, which are smaller, are connected to their rails above by one connector.\n    Commuter Cars are much larger boxcars, and can seat anywhere between sixteen to fourty people.  Commuter Cars usually follow schedules and routes, as opposed to going to a specified location on request.  This makes them more like city busses than a taxi service.  These cars, which are larger than others, are connected to their rails by (at least) two connectors.\n\n    Unlike [!1 trains], Skyrail cabs are able to easily start or stop on command as well as change rails for turning. This gives them the manuverability of a [!2 city bus] while avoiding the traffic of city streets.\u0000css\n    The physical rail networks usually hang over inner city roads and streets.  Because of this, Skyrail rail networks tend to match road networks within a city (though less-traveled roads are typically omitted).  Rails tend to hang over the exact middle of roads (or in the middle of lanes, if there are multiple rails over the same road).  The rails themselves are suspended by supports connected to the ground, or to the sides of structurally-sound buildings.  Skyrail terminals are elevated metal platforms resembling wide catwalks, or small plazas built into the sides of buildings.  Depending on the terminal's size, it may have benches for waiting passengers, restrooms, or other ammenities.  If a terminal is intended to be a node for Personal Cars, it will have a machine of some sort to accept payment (or Skyrail tokens) and summon a Skyrail cab.\n\n    Skyrail was first designed in the year 61 by the [!3 Trametro] company, which has maintained the system's design, applications, and implementations ever since.  The first Skyrail system with implemented in [!4 Liveston City] on [!5 planet Osirja], which quickly became a popular mode of transport.",

Rocketfields are places where spacecraft land and take off from, and are typically divided into two sections. Every rocketfield has a [!1 spaceport] that manages it.\n\n     The first section, referred to as \"the parking lot\", is paved and divided up into evenly-sized lots. These lots are commonly rectangular and are at least 200m^2 in area to allow for adequate clearance for landing ships. This section is only for ships that are able to control their landing, so that they can land in a specific lot. For some rocket fields with heavy traffic, specific lots may be premium. These premium lots are actually hydraulic pads, capable of lowering the craft into the ground. The craft is then covered from above by a large hatch (or sometimes a tarp) to keep it safe from a planet's weather.\n\n     The second section, referred to as \"the field\", is a much larger area, usually upwards of dozens of square kilometers. This section is commonly just open plains of soil or light fauna to act as a cheap cushioning for craft without landing gear (such as [!2 drop pods]).

Most amalgamate-class ships are made out of just a pair of ships for the purposes of greater efficiency, interior volume, or other perks. Though, some of the larger, more successful amalgamate-class crafts are made of dozens to hundreds of smaller craft. Notably, amalgamate-class ships are popular with [!1 Disterrestrialist] communes, as the communes' generation ships, due to their large size requirement, are often constructed out of whatever is available.\n\n    While it's intuitive to think amalgamate-class ships would destroy themselves if they attempted an orbital maneuver, being made of many smaller (usually weakly) connected and asymmetric sections, many of these large craft are upgraded with specialized software modifications.  These software patches allow a ship to read its directional acceleration, rotational acceleration, and thrust of active engines to calculate the craft's center of mass in real time.  Since each section of the craft typically has its own engine cluster, the software is able to direct the craft's [!2 flight computer] to modulate each engine to put out the perfect amount of thrust to keep the ship balanced, correctly-oriented, and most importantly, intact.",

This version of MoTran could be run from disk, but it was more commonly just physically installed on a ROM chip on a system's mother board.\n\n     MoTran Version 1, upon boot, would execute the file \"AUTOEXEC.MSCR\" on the root of the connected drive. This file would be run in the ManuScript interpreter. This version of the system was guided completely by ManuScript, running it in between hardware drivers. Version one did allow for specific hardware drivers to be kept in memory between uses. This feature eliminated load time for high-priority drivers, meaning that they no longer had to be loaded from disk for each use, which saved a lot of time.",

Version 2 is also the first version with native support for [!1 UHB] ports.\n\n   Version 2 requires a system with at least one [!2 Slave Processor], as this version of MoTran ran hardware drivers exclusively on these slave processors. Version 2 dedicates each core to a [!3 ManuScript] script thread, meaning that the system can simultaneously run a number of scripts equal to the number of cores. If there are more active scripts than a machine has cores, the system will start scheduling all script threads to be divided up among the cores leading to a dramatic slowdown in performance.\n\n   The mother processor of the machine is relegated to running the operating system itself, managing the slave processors under it. But, the system allowed for certain programs written in [!4 Machina] to be run on the mother processor, functionally soft-patching them to the kernel. These kernel patches could add, or re-write core system functions, and files for these programs were given the \".KXEC\" file extension. A common type kernel program was a process that could output system information graphically. Graphical User Interfaces for MoTran have prooved very useful in using the operating system.",

MoTran 3 is a direct upgrade from MoTran 2, being largely the same system architecture. Almost all drivers made for MoTran 2 are compatible with Version 3; MoTran 3 was intended to be backwards-compatible by design.\n\n   Using the new GUI, MoTran 3 allows for deeper control over hardware processes, as well as allowing for more detailed debugging of drivers and [!1 ManuScript] processes. MoTran 3 was programmed for better allocation of system resources, meaning that MoTran will no longer suffer from dramatic slowdowns when the number of software threads exceeds the number of [!2 slave cores] in the machine.\n\n   Like MoTran 2, MoTran 3 allows for the kernel to be soft-patched with programs written in [!3 Machina]. These kernel programs still use the extension \".KXEC\".\n\n   MoTran 3 is one of the most widely-used operating systems in the known galaxy, being used in aircraft, lathes, mills, spacecraft, general terrestrial craft, [!4 warp drive] controllers, and even [!5 power armor].",

Each slave processor is paired with a [!1 memory] chip of any size.  This memory chip is exclusive to that slave processor and is called a \"cache\".  Together, the slave processor and memory chip make something called a 'core'.  Every slave processor core is controlled and directed by the 'mother processor'.  The mother processor is the only processor within a parallel architecture machine with hardware privileges.  Therefore, any program running on a slave core must negotiate with the code on the mother processor for hardware access.  This, along with the fact that a program running on one core cannot easily access the data of another, is why the parallel computer architecture is considered the most secure modern architecture.\u0000css\n    The number of cores a machine has determines the number of threads it can compute at once.  The mother processor is able to stop/start any core (meaning any program thread) at any time.  The mother processor also has complete control over the memory within each core, being able to change the program or data within each core during runtime with no restrictions.  The mother processor also determines what sections of Main Memory a core is allowed to access.\n\n    The memory in each core is (usually) limited to 64KiB and consists of [!2 Electric Memory], which is very fast. Main Memory, a special, larger section of memory separate from the cores, can be up to 4GiB (or more) in size and is controlled by the Mother Processor.  Though, despite this, Main Memory is much slower than core memory because it is usually made of [!3 Qi Memory].  A slave core attempting to run code directly from Main Memory will slow to a crawl due to the slower memory speeds.  This is why the amount of fast memory in a core determines what threads it can (effectively) process, as every program requires a certain amount of memory to be run.",

Galactic Standard time was drafted and established in the year 28.\n\nThe units in GST are as follows:\n    Standard [!1 Scientific] hour, minute, and second.\n    Day - A Galactic Day is a period of 22 hours.\n    Month - A Galactic Month is a period of 40 days\n    Year - A Galactic Year is a period of 14 months.\n\n    Each month of the galactic year has a specific name. The names of the months, ordered from the beginning of the year to the end, are as follows:\n    CopperFlame - Named by Deorian delegates\n    Crystone- Named by La'Foyan delegates\n    Deriz - Named by Gallean delegates\n    Bloom - Named by Armalite delegates\n    Lereai - Named by Gallean delegates\n    HarvestCrest - Named by Tyventian delegates\n    Karmil - Named by Tyventian delegates\n    SteelFell - Named by Tuine delegates\n    Lunakin - Named by Ghillymedic delegates\n    SiltCrest - Named by Tyventian delegates\n    TinBell - Named by Deorian delegates\n    Etherglide - Named by Itascan delegates\n    Crimson - Named by La'Foyan delegates\n    Apofel - Named by Solar Union delegates\n\n    Up until the year 87, names of galactic months were undefined, many of them just being named by their numeric placement within the year, or named after a planet's months from [!2 local time]. Throughout the year 87, a council was assembled from artistic and social delegates from every member planet of the [!3 GCP]. These delegates compiled common names for these months from across the known galaxy, as well as producing new names for those months without common titles.",

        "data": "css\n    Entropism is described as a belief system revolving around observing entropy. The word is derived from the word \"Entropy\", a measure of disorder and distribution of energy in a system, and the suffix \"-ism\", denoting a belief in or following of something. A common belief in this religion is that one is able to use entropy to gain insights about the world around them that they wouldn't be able to with normal means.\n\n    Entropism is popular belief in [!1 Deoria], being followed by 38% of the population; and [!2 Ghillymede], being followed by 59% of the population. It also has a small following in the nations [!3 Armalai] and the [!4 Solar Union], with less than 10% of the population identifying as Entropist.\n\n    The detail that classifies Entropism as a theistic religion is the belief that the universe itself is, or has a consciousness. This consciousness has free will, and with this free will, it exerts changes and forces in particles of matter. Individually, these changes to particles are too small to be measured with any physical tools. Together, the forces on each particle add up to move fluid matter, such as minutely effecting the flow of water, or creating a draft in the air. While these changes can be measured, the contributing forces are small enough that they can be dismissed as nothing more than the random movement of particles.\u0000css\n    Entropism, or belief systems resembling it, have been recorded to have started independently in many places throughout the galaxy. Though, its deepest developments root back to the planet [!4 Deoria], where the major tenets of the religion were thought to have developed. Entropism, as we know it today, was first developed in the -30s, solidifying the common beliefs of the religion.\n\n    Devoted Entropists gather weekly on a weekday of their choosing. They gather in buildings, or simply defined areas, called Totem Houses. Entropists believe that, when trying to communicate with the universe, that greater numbers means greater power in the same way that larger numbers of people can produce a louder voice. In these gatherings, the Entropists decide on something they desire to Universe to influence that requires a large change, then they pray to the Universe together to try to convince it to enact the desired changes. After prayer, the gathering typically either leaves, or they stay for other social activities.\n\n    Some devoted followers of Entropism claim that their connection with the Universe's consciousness is so strong, that the Universe is able to directly manipulate the chemistry and synapses of their brain. This, allegedly, gives the person the ability to listen to, or even directly communicate with the Universe. These people are either referred to as \"Prophets\", or \"Lunatics\" based on their popularity.\n    \n    Though Entropism has received criticism from realist and secular groups for having no base in real physics, many of the core beliefs of the system are un-disprovable. For example, the claim that the Universe acts on forces too small to be measured is, by definition, un-disprovable, due to the fact that no real-world tools would be able to gather evidence against the claim.",

        "data": "css\n    While, like most religions, Entropism varies across the galaxy, there are a few notable common traits.\n\n    Transmission Pendulum:\n        A Transmission Pendulum it a tool used to communicate with the Universe. The common name for a Transmission Pendulum is a \"Hand Totem\", or they are just informally referred to as a \"Totem\". These pendulums are long fins arranged in an 'X' shape with two pairs of fins perpendicular to each other, or a 'Y' shape with three fins placed 120° apart. The 'X' arrangement is the more popular of the two in most Entropist communities. Though, notably, on [!1 Armalai] and [!2 Ganeimede], Entropists almost exclusively carry 'Y' shaped Transmission Pendulums. The fins, typically made of a light metal, are attached to a long chain, string, or other cable. While the lengths of the fins and cable can vary, the total length is usually around 30cm. A person uses a Transmission Pendulum by looping the string around their finger (or equivalent limb) and letting the pendulum hang at least 40cm away from their body. Once the pendulum has stopped swaying from the user's moving it into place, they then attempt to talk to the Universe's consciousness. They ask the Universe a question or make a request of it. Whether this communication is verbal or not is irrelevant; most Entropists believe that spoken language, thoughts, and the air disturbed by the pendulum are equally understandable to the Universe. While making their request, an Entropist will lightly sway the pendulum. This act is thought to embed the user's wishes into the disorder of the matter around them. Once they are done with this part of the prayer, they stop the motion of the pendulum. They then wait for a response based on the movement of the pendulum due to the currents of the air and/or the small, random movements of their bodies. The pendulum can give one of four responses: Swaying towards the user, swaying parallel to the user, swaying circularly, or remaining still.\u0000css\n    Totems and Totem Houses:\n        A Totem House is a place of religious gathering for Entropists. They are large buildings or outdoor structures that seat at least 10 people. The centerpiece of any Totem House is a massive transmission pendulum called a Totem. These Totems are many times larger than a handheld transmission pendulum, being upwards of two meters long. Totems are affixed by a rope or chain to a pulley on the ceiling. The room/space that the Totem hangs in is called the Glade. Using the rope and pulley, the congregation gather to pull and release the rope in order to cause the totem to swing. Glades are shaped like tall domes, sometimes even being described as \"egg-shaped\". Glades are very open spaces; very enclosed glades have just two large windows which allow the Totem to swing through them without striking the walls, while very open glades are constructed out of just a few arches to allow the Totem more freedom of movement. Glades are also open to allow airflow from outside to exert force on the Totem, so that the congregation may interpret communications from the Universe from its motion.\n        \n    Diffusion Watching:\n        Traditionally called \"Tear Shattering\", Diffusion Watching is the act of taking a clear fluid (clean water) and dripping one, or multiple drops of a dye or other visible fluid into it. By watching the seemingly random patterns in which the drop diffuses into the fluid, one could use it as a suitable, detectable type of entropy to interpret a response from the Universe after a prayer. In the past, Tear Shattering was seen by some as a method of congregated prayer. A congregation of Entropists would gather at the edge of a body of water before pouring cups, buckets, or barrels of dye into the water. This practice is rare in the modern era, as most districts on civilized planets treat the act as needless pollution, and most Entropists still believe a Totem is more appropriate for group prayer.",

        "data": "css\n    Local Time is timekeeping method based on the physical attributes of the body on which the Local Time is used. Initially, the units used within a local time system were completely different from those of another. As [!1 Unil] was spread and popularized across the known galaxy, the names for these units of time were standardized, even though they were still of different lengths. The common names for these units (in order of size) are as follows:\n    Year     - (Y) The orbital period of the local body\n    Season   - (S) A large fraction of a year, usually defined by changes in climate\n    Lunen    - (L) A fraction of a Season or Year, typically based on the orbital period of a natural satellite\n    Period   - (P) An uncommon subdivision of a Lunen\n    Sol      - (S) The rotational period of the local body, usually an even fraction of a Lunen\n    Meridian - (M) Almost exclusively one half of a Sol, though sometimes one third or fourth \n    Watch    - (W) Commonly a large fraction of a Sol\n    Tone     - (T) Commonly a small fraction of a Day or a large fraction of a Watch\n    Dash     - (d) Commonly a fraction of a Tone in any size\n    Point    - (p) The smallest unit that sees common use, a fraction of a Tone\n    Moment   - (m) A rare unit name used if the local time system in question uses a unit of time smaller than a Point\u0000css\n    To efficiently describe the local time system of a planet, many people write what is called a \"Time Table String\" to describe the units a local time system uses, as well as the proportions. Take the Time Table String \"1Y/2S/4L/24S/4W/6T/4d/36p\" for example. In it, it describes on year as being made up of two seasons, each season being made up of 4 Lunens, each Lunen being made up of 24 Sols, and so on. And using the period of the planet's rotation or orbit, one could do simple division or multiplication to solve for the exact measurements of each unit in the string. In the event that a planet's time system does not use a common name for a unit of time, the name for the unit is written out in full as opposed to using a common unit's abbreviation.\n\n    Some planets make use of a \"Floating Chronal Reference\". Having a Floating Chronal Reference means that, for an observer on the surface of a world, the current time within a day is not constant across the planet. Instead, it is based on the planet's sun's position within the sky (or more accurately, the longitude of the observer). Commonly on these planets, the local time of sol is determined by sunrise, local noon, or even sunset. For example, on [!2 planetary Itascus], the local Tone of Day is determined by time of local noon; 10-o-clock (Halfway through the sol) is defined as when the sun is in the middle of its arc across the sky.\u0000css\n    Planets with Floating Chronal Reference almost exclusively use a Time Zone system. In a Time Zone system, the planet is divided up longitudinally into equally-sized slices called Time Zones. Time Zones are used for large units of time that are less than a sol, such as Meridians, Watches, or Tones. The number of time zones on a world is determined by the number of units that the zones are divided by within a sol. For example, if the Timezones on a planet are based on Watches, and there are six watches in a local sol, the planet will have six Timezones. Time is the same everywhere within a Timezone, with each zone's time being determined based on its longitude. To represent Floating Chronal References and Timezones in a Time Table String, the string is prefixed with the following: the event that determines the time of day, sunrise ('R'), noon ('N'), or sunset ('S'); what time of day that this event determines (as well as the unit); and a character describing if the planet uses Timezones ('Z') (followed by the unit the timezones are measured in), or the time is absolute ('A') based purely on an observer's longitude. So, for example, planetary Itascus's string is \"N-10:00T ZT 1Y/12L/18D/20T/40d\", because the Floating Chronal Reference is based on local noon, and local noon is defined as 10-o-clock in Tones, and the planet makes use of Timezones that are divided by the number of Tones in a sol.",

        "data": "css\n    By the year -114, [!1 Gallea's] population had increased to over one billion. Around this time, two popular political positions developed, Hierarchism  and Late Industrialism. Hierarchism was strongly aligned with the ideology of capitalism as well as minor ideologies of small government. Hierarchism was backed by the leaderships of states and nations that descended from the tribes. Late Industrialism was more aligned with the standard ideals of socialism and a larger government. Late Industrialism was backed primarily by members that identified as Gallea's working class, who felt like their tribes and governments weren't meant just to help people from the outside, but financially in the inside as well. Though they still didn't believe in full government control. \n\n    By the year -53, the population had reached 1.2 billion and political tensions soon arose between the tribes and nations of the planet; the rising popularity of the planet's two main political parties instilled an “us versus them” mentality into many residents of the world. Within a decade, the scattered tribes and micronations banded together as they saw foreign ideologies as more and more of a threat to their own ways of life. The majority of the townships and tribes governed by a Republic system banded together into a federacy we call the SDD (Strategic Democratic Defense). The other townships and kingdoms, primarily with monarchical or autocratic rule, formed into two major factions. These factions were the RGU (Royal Gallean Union), which functioned less as an alliance and more a union into a single state ruled by Monarch democracy, and the GSA (Gallean Sovereigns Alliance), which was structured as a confederation. The SDD was strictly Late Industrialist by popular ideology, that being the trait that brought them together.-\u0000css\nThe GSA was fervently Hierarchist in direct opposition to the SDD, while the RGU was presenting itself as more centrist, while still leaning towards political Hierarchism. These names were translated from native Gallean into [!2 Unil].\n\n    Within a [!3 planetary year] of their formation, the GSA and SDD declared each other political enemies and general adversaries. The diplomatic tensions between GSA and SDD quickly boiled over, spurring a surprise invasion from the GSA into SDD territories with the intention of destroying the commoner governments. This marked the beginning of the Gallean World War, simply called the “War of Two Nations”. \n\n    The RGU kept itself neutral for three years while the war went on around them. That was, until the [!4 Skirmish of Shells]. This brought the RGU into the world war, changing the conflict's common name to “The Trio's War”. The 3-way war would end up killing 285 million Galleats, devastating cities across the globe. Throughout the seemingly endless bloodshed, the world's workforce was aligning more and more with the ideas of Industrialism, regardless of the proclaimed ideologies of their nations. The RGU was the first to convert to Late Industrialism, due to internal political pressure in -47. The RGU and SSD made an impromptu alliance in response to the change in political ties. The SSD shared a new technology with the RGU; a technology for higher definition, secure radio transmission. Working together, the RGU and SSD warred the GSA into submission by -46, ending the Gallean World War.",

The conflict between the two factions started on 4/8/-50, formally starting the skirmish. To keep their border from being invaded, the RGU military sent an infantry battalion to construct fortifications within their territory. The RGU infantry gathered in an abandoned mining village in the hills which they fortified and turned into a defensive position.\n\n     Both the GSA and SSD's scouts noticed the RGU's fortified hill position. Since neither party was aware of the RGU's presence, they both independently assumed it belonged to the other side, regardless of the position's distance from the main conflict. On the third [!2 galactic day] of the conflict, the hill base was bombarded by heavy artillery from both the GSA and the SDD. The leadership of the base declared it a direct attack, and communicated with the RGU military headquarters. The RGU military leaders began mobilizing more troops, and instructed the base to eliminate the enemy artillery.\u0000css\n     While the RGU's hill fort was being bombarded many times an hour, 1,500 of the RGU soldiers in the camp marched for three hours to go around the front lines of the main conflict and flank the GSA artillery, which was set up far from the trenches and hills. The surprise attack was a success, eliminating all three of the GSA's heavy artillery units as well as all the operators and the infantry escort. The surprise attack only wounded 32 RGU soldiers, and only killed 22. \n\n     The GSA infantry on the front lines, informed of the attack by radio before the position was destroyed, reasoned that they were routed by SSD attackers, and decided to retreat by a few kilometers. Since the small RGU force was returning to base after the surprise attack, they encountered many large companies of retreating GSA soldiers. This was the biggest cause of RGU casualties in the conflict, as they only returned to base with about 600 out of the 1,500 soldiers that left to strike the artillery.\n\n     In conclusion, this battle caused the GSA to lose a few kilometers of territory to the SSD as the front line advanced towards them. The RGU also formally entered the [!3 Gallean World War].",

        "data": "css\n    As [!1 Ganeimede] appeared to be losing the [!2 Ganeimedic Rebelion], the Ganeimedic leadership was willing to try any idea to turn the tide of the crisis. They decided that the need to look for help from somewhere. And it couldn't be from [!3 Itascus] or [!4 Gallea]. They decided that their best course of action would be to get the public on their side. And so, they recorded an audio message, one that was meant for the world's ears. \n\n    The message they recorded was a plea for help. In proper [!5 Unil], the message was the following: “We, the people of Ganeimede, are but a small, lunar mining colony. Our only desire was the right to control the sale of the valuable materials that we mine ourselves, from our own planet. And for this, we are being invaded by foriegn powers. This is an affront to our autonomy, and even an affront to the very idea of a free cosmos. If this can be allowed to happen, what kind of example does this set for the future? If you can hear us, please, heed our plea; otherwise, we might not be heard for much longer.”\u0000css\n    The colony had no internet access, so it couldn't be uploaded. Broadcasting the message wouldn't reach beyond the invading Itacan army or the hemisphere of Gallea facing them. And it wasn't unreasonable to assume that attempting to send a ship with a copy of the message would only result in it being shot down. So, Ganeimedic leadership contacted their single warp-capable freighter in orbit. This freighter hadn't moved since the arrival of the Itascan occupation force. The freighter was contacted and given special instructions; the crew of two was, after receiving a copy of the message, to warp out of the [!6 Gavia] system and head to [!7 Deoria] and [!8 Bius Tu], sending copies of the message to news outlets on both worlds. After they were briefed, the crew were securely transmitted a copy. The copy was saved to a cassette tape. The Itascan occupation detected the craft warping away as they left with the message, but they were under the impression that the ship was still aligned with Gallea.\n\n    The messenger ship stopped near Bius Tu and promptly entered a stable orbit. They then docked with the [!9 Gazer] station. The crew of two entered the station to tell Ganeimede's side of the occupation. News of the Itascan occupation had already spread over the internet, but details were unclear. By chance, the leader of the Tuine nation, Bius Tu himself, was on Gazer for diplomatic reasons. The two messengers promptly requested an audience with the Tuine leader. After explaining who they were, they were allowed to briefly speak with Bius Tu. They played him their copy of the plea, and virtually begged for assistance. After a brief discussion, the Tuine leader told the messengers that their plea would be considered, and they were dismissed. The message was picked up by popular Tuine news organizations, and happened to gain more social traction among the Tuine populus compared to that of Deoria, being picked up by more mainstream media outlets on the planet.\u0000css\n    The freighter warped into Deoria's SOI and burned into a low, stable orbit. The craft then rendezvoused with [!10 The Nexus] and docked with it. After giving a copy of the message to anyone who would listen, they bartered for some supplies. They left within four hours of docking, cautious that Itascan warp-capable ships might have been looking for them. They warped away, heading for planet Bius Tu. The message, along with the story it related to, was quickly picked up by minor news outlets, but was largely dismissed by larger news corporations. The story gained some attention with the Deorian populous, and there was a small social push for government action to help the Ganeimedic miners. But this was challenged by a popular counter argument that it was not in national Deoria's best interest to sour relations with Gallea, or more importantly, Itascus, by assisting a small colony on a distant moon.\n\n    The crew of two, now that the message had been adequately delivered, decided that their directive had been fulfilled. Without instruction for what they should do after the mission, they considered what they should do next. They reasoned that returning to the Gavia system would mean the destruction of their craft upon detection, so they decided not to return home, at least not yet. Instead, they traded the last of the Helium-3 onboard their freighter for a sizable amount of food, water, and Hydrogen fuel. They then warped into local interplanetary space, and went radio silent.\n\n    Copies of the message spread from Deoria and Bius Tu across the fledgling internet. Notably, it eventually reached the Itascan and [!11 Ghillian] populations. The spread of the message to these locations is credited as being essential to the outcome of the Ganeimedic Rebellion.",

        "data": "css\n    As the [!1 Gallean government] started planning to colonize the planet [!2 Zerania], it became obvious that they would need many more warp-capable ships in order to reasonably bring enough resources to the planet to colonize it. Determined to stop relying on [!3 Itascus] for warp-drive materials, they began establishing mining sites on their moon, [!4 Ganeimede] in the year 42, collecting Helium-3 for use in making [!5 warp cores]. However, the project proved to be costly. Over time, the mining sites evolved into mining colonies, accidentally becoming a fully-colonized planet under Gallean control. \n\n    Under the weight of the new space logistics program to move Helium-3 and other resources, as well as the standard social welfare it was already paying to the miners, the program was having trouble financially. The wages of the miners became mismanaged, and eventually they were quietly lowered to ease the stress on the system. The lunar colonies expressed their discontent, but the government stated that there was nothing that could be done at the time. Many Ganeimedic miners expressed a desire to go on strike, but realized it would be logistical suicide; at that time, Ganeimede had no method of producing food or other essential products, so its citizens were reliant on their homeworld for their survival.\u0000css\n    Over the course of the next five years, the colony kept working to produce the Helium-3 that was being sent to Gallea for processing. All the while, they were improving their own infrastructure; they built indoor farms (as Ganeimede barely has an atmosphere to support plant life), water reclaimers, subsurface mines, metal foundries, oxygen generators, and every other essential machine for life on a planet. This also stimulated Ganeimede's internal economy. And, even though the Ganeimedic colonists were vocal about their discontent, their gripes were mostly silenced by the Gallean government back home, so new colonists were still arriving. In fact, the number of arriving colonists increased as new industry jobs were opening up. By the end of the five-year period, the population of the moon went from just under 2,000, to approximately 16,000. The planet kept its near unanimous, resentful attitude towards its homeworld, but since their collective voice was getting quieter over time and there was nothing they could really do, the attitude was ignored by the homeworld government.\n\n    In the year 47, the moon finally had all the systems in place that it needed to be self-sustaining. The mistreated workers could finally make a statement. They sent a formal message to the leaders of the mining program on Gallea, which was forwarded to Gallean government. The message stated that the colony desired to have control over the Helium-3 it mined, who they sold it to, and for what price. If their desire was not met, they would go on strike, and stop producing Helium-3 entirely. The Gallean government responded with offering to instead raise the workers' wages back to what was originally promised. The colony declined within a day, and added that if Gallea fails to make a choice soon, it would default to going on strike. The Gallean government was not willing to be rid of the cheap source of warp core material that Ganeimede presented.\u0000css\n    Neither Ganeimede or Gallea had any weapons of interplanetary bombardment, [!6 spacecraft] with weaponry, or even any [!7 combat spacesuits]. Seeing their foothold on the Aptha market starting to slip, the Gallean government quietly called an emergency [!8 GUN] summit on the matter. The Gallean leader, the Itascan [!9 Vice President], a [!10 Deorian] envoy, and a [!11 Tuine] envoy attended the summit. Gallea explained the problem on their hands, and offered 15% of the mineral rights of Ganeimede for 100 years to any party that would help bring the moon back under control. Deoria and Bius Tu expressed no interest, but the Itascan Vice President, after communicating with [!12 Itascus Himself], agreed to the terms. The Itascan government, at that time, had the second largest fleet of military spacecraft in the GUN. The Itascan military saw it as an easy mission, as Ganeimede's lack of any sort of military hardware was common knowledge. At the time, the GUN had a law stating that no two planetary nations could go to war with one another. And since Ganeimede had just under the population requirement to count as a colonized planet, ~16,100 out of the seemingly-arbitrary 16,384, it did not legally count as war. So, by starting hostilities towards Ganeimede, Itascus would not be breaking any international law.\n\n    Four days later, the [!13 I.T. Apocalypse] was in orbit of Ganeimede, acting as a Forward Operating Base for Itascus's occupation of the moon. The Itascan forces sent down eight [!14 Pelican-class ships], each containing three Itascan soldiers with small arms ([!15 pistols] and [!16 smgs]) and combat spacesuits. The Itascan army had no intention of opening fire on the unarmed colonists; they were ordered to prioritize causing no civilian casualties. But the Ganeimedics didn't know this, and they assumed the invaders to be dangerous.\u0000css\n    Each Itascan landing craft touched down at a large population center. They ordered each population center to allow them to land in the town's [!17 spaceport]. They had to request entry because, since Ganeimede has a miniscule atmosphere, every spaceport is inside an airtight environment, with each silo being sealed off with a hatch. Only two population centers obliged, though, meaning that the other six landing craft had to land on the Ganeimedic terrain near the towns, after which, they were still barred from entry on foot. The soldiers could not forcibly enter the towns, as breaching the structures would've undoubtedly caused civilian casualties.\n\n    Even though most towns on the surface were safe from harm from the Itascans (at the time), the Ganeimedics were aware of how poor their odds of coming out of this conflict victoriously, or even unscathed, were. And so, they recorded an audio message, and sent it off with their only warp-capable ship. This message was [!18 The Plea of Ganeimede], and caught the attention of the Tuine government, leading to them deciding to assist the lunar colony. The plea also gathered a large amount of attention from the citizens of [!19 Ghilly]. The Ghillians felt sympathetic towards the Gameimedics' plight, having started as a small moon colony themselves. But, while Ghilly did have a considerable population at the time, they didn't have the military resources to effectively help the colonists.\u0000css\n    Within two months, a large Tuine freighter ship stocked with weaponry, which couldn't legally be engaged by Itascan or Gallean combatants, warped to Ganeimede. The freighter entered a low orbit over the moon, starting short-range communications with Ganeimedic leadership. During which, the freighter refused all hails from the I.T. Apocalypse, though the ship was still broadcasting its [!20 callsign]. After confirming that the story told by the Ganeimedic messengers, the ones who were sent off with a copy of The Plea of Ganeimede, was accurate, they offered to help the colonists. The Tuine freighter stocked a landing craft with personal weaponry, and the lunar towns allowed the lander to park in each town's indoor rocket silo, one by one. With each landing, the local colonists were given dozens upon dozens of small arms, as well as combat spacesuits, to allow them to defend themselves.\n\n    The Itascan ground forces, which were still present, witnessed the Tuine lander visit each major Ganeimedic township, and reported it to the Apocalypse. The Apocalypse attempted, again, to hail to Tuine freighter, but the ship still refused to communicate. At this point, all eight major townships (excluding the two that allowed the Itascan occupation to enter) had weaponry, and they planned a coordinated attack. The colonists were also given a [!21 Quantum Comm] node, allowing for them to connect some devices to the galactic internet.\n\n    Under the cover of night, six Ganeimedic towns sent out small teams of colonists armed with [!22 ballistic weapons] and dawned in combat spacesuits. Each team stationed themselves at least 400 meters from an Itascan landing craft and waited for further instruction. Once all six teams were armed and in position, they fired in the direction of every exposed Itascan landing ship. The teams were instructed not to explicitly kill any of the invaders, only to make it known that they were now well-armed.\u0000css\n    The Itascan soldiers, stationed in their spacecraft, couldn't hear the sound of the automatic weaponry when stood outside in the vacuum, but from inside their landing craft, they could hear the bullets colliding with the hull. As the bullets were hitting the regolith around the ships, kicking up large clouds of dust, each of the six Itascan ships on the surface of Ganeimede simultaneously hailed the I.T. Apocalypse, declaring that they were being attacked by unidentified assailants, and were unable to return fire as they could not determine the direction from which the attacks were coming. Within minutes, the Itascan forces ordered all landing parties to return to orbit and rendezvous with the Apocalypse to regroup. Each of the six landing parties on the surface fled Ganeimede before re-docking to the Apocalypse. The two landing parties that were allowed entry into the towns' silos found themselves stuck, as both of the towns they were parked in locked down the silos as they gathered there, trapping them on Ganeimede.\n\n    The Apocalypse went radio silent as the occupation communicated with the Itascan leadership. Many groups of colonists had started celebrating as soon as the Itascan forces had left the surface, regardless of the fact that little had actually ended. Acting quickly, the Ganeimedic directors recorded another message. Though copies of the audio message itself have been lost, the terms were as follows: In exchange for the Itascan military stopping its occupation of Ganeimede, the six Itascan soldiers trapped in their rocket silos would be released. The Apocalypse would not accept any hail from any Ganeimedic or unrecognized craft. So instead, the colonists borrowed the transmitter from one of the captured Itascan landers. When the message was sent this time, it was acknowledged, but not responded to. And, for a short time, life continued as it was in the colony, even though the Apocalypse stayed in a high, polar orbit.\u0000css\n    The rebellion was attracting media coverage at this point. Media outlets had reporters stationed on and around the moon. Some were even allowed into the cabins and structures of the towns, interviewing the colonists on their thoughts about the encounter. Many of the colonists were surprised to hear the reporters referring to the event as a rebellion; the colony had not explicitly considered severing from the Gallean nation. Though, at that point, it seemed like it might have been inevitable, given how their homeworld had reacted to their resistance. Notably, media coverage of the event had reached the Itascan public. The new information was dense and concerning, in stark contrast to what little information was provided by state news.\n\n    A pair of Itascan [!23 Lucifer-Model] spacecraft warped into Ganeimedic space and entered a low orbit. Broadcasting their callsigns, they made their presence known to the colony. The Lucifer model of spacecraft was, and still is, designed for remote bombardment of a planet's surface. Onboard one of the Lucifers was the Itascan leader himself, [!24 Harry Lee], being present to oversee the endeavor. The ltascan president mass-broadcasted a message to the surface of the moon, relayed and amplified by the Apocalypse and the second Lucifer. “This is the Itascan president, Harry Lee. I am broadcasting to tell everyone in this planetary system that the Ganeimedic rebels have three sols(8.6 Galactic Days) to release the six Itascan prisoners of war, and return to production. Otherwise the largest structures on the planet will be bombarded from orbit.”\u0000css\n    Every population center on the moon received the message. Celebrations stopped. Journalists left the surface to watch from orbit. The Ganeimedic leadership was frantic, seeing their planet backed into a corner. Within hours, they contacted the Tuine military asking for their help, or at least their advice. A Tuine representative replied that they were unable to help; they weren't allowed to attack the Itascan fleet, and donating a frigate to the colonists would be expensive and likely only provoke a more violent response from the Itascan army. Instead, they informed the colonists that Ghillian leadership had been trying to contact them, securely. The colonists agreed to have their communications forwarded to Ghilly, opening talks with the fellow lunar world.\n\n    Through the media coverage of Ganeimede's predicament, the Ghillian people became sentimental to the colony's struggles. There was popular demand on Ghilly to help the colonists, and the government had been covertly formulating plans to assist the Ganeimedics, to help fix their perilous issue. Though, the Ghillians needed confirmation from the colony in order for them to help; their plan, the only plan they could theoretically work in the small amount of time allotted, required the Ganeimedic colony to commit to a full rebellion from Gallea. \n\n    The Ghillian proposition was transmitted to the other towns on the moon, and it was met with almost unanimous support. The colonists felt mistreated by their homeworld, even more so at that point than at the beginning of their strike; most of the colonists were elated when presented with a real opportunity to separate from the Gallean nation. The Ganeimedic leadership quickly sent their reply, accepting the Ghillians' help. And so, the Ganeimedic leadership was told the plan.\u0000css\n    Just seven days after the Itascan occupation broadcasted its warning message, five Ghillian ships appeared around Ganeimede, quickly landing as soon as they canceled their velocity. The five ships were [!25 Transit-class] spacecraft, equipped with the fastest warp drives, in total carrying over two-hundred Ghillian citizens. Again, all hails from the I.T. Apocalypse were refused. Despite the silence, the occupation forces did know the Ghillian plan, to a small extent; after the plan was discussed within the colony, details started to spread into the news as rumors. Immediately upon landing, the two-hundred Ghillian volunteers declared themselves citizens of Ganeimede, and the mayors of each of the towns formalized them as such. As soon as the transport ships landed on the moon (before the volunteers were actually given citizenship) the Ghillian and Ganeimedic governments declared that, since the colony now met the population requirement of 16,384, it legally counted as a populated world. Therefore, it could not legally be attacked under GUN law. As a show of good faith, the Ganeimedic colony released the six Itascan prisoners, allowing them to return to the Apocalypse unharmed.\u0000css\n    The galaxy got word of Ganeimede's new status, and they were largely supported by the general public. The rebellion was now a more popular topic than ever, being talked about across all the GUN's nations. Though the Itascan army was indifferent to the moon's declaration. The Itascan president, who was still in orbit of Ganeimede, was determined to secure the mineral rights and saw the Ganeimedic plot too ramshackle and impromptu to actually be considered legal. Though, the Itascan president was contacted by his social advisor back on their homeworld. The social advisor argued that, at this point, the general political backlash that would result from attacking the colony would far outweigh any boost to warp drive production would be worth. The president was reluctant to hear this from his advisor, even being described as vivid. Eventually, he relented, and ordered the Itascan ships to silently return to Itascus.\n\n    And so, without a single life lost, Ganeimede gained its independence, and Bius Tu and Ghilly and strong allies. Only a year later, at the next [!26 GUN Meeting], Ghilly and Ganeimede announced that they were forming together into a union, the nation now known as Ghillymede.",

        "data": "css\n   A Combat Spacesuit is simply a [!1 spacesuit] that has been designed or modified for use in combat. These spacesuits can be augmented with light armor, heavy armor, energy armor, or any variation or combination of the three.\n\n   Creating a spacesuit designed to sustain damage (while keeping its operator alive) is a daunting challenge. There is an inherent fragility to equipment that is designed to maintain a thin, flexible barrier between a human and hard vacuum. Since a single breach in a standard spacesuit could lead to the death of the person inside within minutes, changes would need to be made if troops were to be expected to be fired at with light munitions and survive.\u0000css\n   There are two main types of Combat Spacesuits: Light Combat Spacesuits, and Heavy Combat Spacesuits.\n\n   Light Combat Spacesuits vary only slightly from standard spacesuits. Notably, Light Combat Spacesuits have every non-bending surface covered by an armor plate. Every joint on the suit (that can't be covered with a rigid plate without completely restricting movement) is protected by metal cuffs that stem from adjacent armor plates. These cuffs are placed at the elbows, shoulders, knees, and ankles. Since the waist does not have a metal cuff to protect the airtight inner spacesuit, they are instead by a veil or curtain of ballistic weave. Light Combat Spacesuits are dawned by military personnel who operate in the outermost cabins of combat [!2 spacecraft], whom are most likely to be struck by shrapnel from enemy fire. Though, those on inner cabins of military craft (or any cabin of non-military craft) are more often provided normal spacesuits, as they have less of a dexterity loss when compared to combat spacesuits.\n   \n   Heavy Combat Spacesuits are used in rare occasions where there is a need for infantry on a planet without an atmosphere. Heavy Combat Spacesuits more closely resemble [!3 power armor] than any kind of standard spacesuit. Since it's expected that these suits will be struck by direct fire, they are much, much bulkier than Light Combat Spacesuits. They typically consist of three layers: the inner spacesuit, which keeps the operator alive; an inner layer of ballistic weave wrapped over the spacesuit, designed to catch any shrapnel coming from the outer later; and an outer layer of thick armor plating. Heavy Combat Spacesuits can weigh up to 70 kilograms and greatly dampens a soldier's agility. Though, since the use of the armor is restricted to low-gravity worlds lacking an atmosphere",

Your current path is displayed above the page data. for example, the path of this very article is \"/HOME/HELP/BASIC_NAV\". \n\n  There are a few commands used to navigate around Netpedia, and here we will cover some of them.\n\n  The command \"cd ..\" is a special command that tells your machine to make your path go down by one layer. This means it will remove the last element from your path string. For example, lets say if you were on the path \"/ROOT/NATIONS/GCP/MAIN\" and typed the command \"cd ..\", it would remove the last element from your path, meaning that your path would then be \"/ROOT/NATIONS/GCP\".\n\n  Another command is \"back\". This command takes you to the page you were on previously. For example, if you were on a page called \"page 1\" and followed a link that took you to a page called \"page 2\", you could then type the command \"back\" to return to the page you were on previously. And if you were to type \"back\" once more, you would be taken to the page you were viewing before \"page 1\", and so on.",

        "isUp": true,
        "data": "css\n    In the beginning, Gallean life was a cold existence. Without fire, they huddled primitively in small, temporary, buildings made of packed snow and ice to shelter them from the cold. Few notable events happened as they traveled nomadically across Gallea's rocky surface. Though, in this time, their local folklore and [!1 religion] was greatly developed.\n\n    It wasn't until around the year -12,000 P.W. that they began to use dead plant matter as fuel for fires. This allowed for permanent settlements to be constructed. Within a matter of decades, many gatherings of ancient Galleats developed methods of agriculture, and subsequently animal husbandry, to sustain their sedentary lifestyles. The population quadrupled from 20,000 to 80,000 globally by the year -6,000. Annual growth had been slow and sluggish as surplus food was rare, leading to the development of closely-knit tribes in this 6,000-year timeframe. Some of these tribes would grow into small republics or kingdoms. Wars would occur and the population was stagnant until the year -821, when the legendary inventor, Xerlia Veras Gheriz, hailing from the Veraz tribe, studied the botany of Gallean plants and discovered much more efficient methods of producing heat energy, kickstarting a small industrial revolution across the planet.\u0000css\n    The revolution affected the planet's scientific progression, as well as its society. The new heating methods even allowed for food to be grown in more enclosed spaces, safe from the weather. This allowed farmers to breed out the hardy, unpalatable, weather-resistant traits in favor of breeding in more efficient, and more fruitful traits, making the food more edible. This led to a surplus of food, and population boomed, reaching 100 million globally by the year -500. This continued growth aided in letting ancient galleats specialize in their skills, as not every person had to commit to producing food. This led The new technology that used the friction heat tech soon powered and heated homes by -400.  The advancement of science continued, bringing new ideas on trade and lifestyle. \n\n    The population was reaching 1 billion by the year -114. And around this time the [!2 Gallean World War] was set into motion. Out of the war came a new global government that forsook the old tribal divisions from whence it came, and focused on the world's progress at large. It took six years, until the year -40, for the government to stabilize its control and functionally tax its citizens. The new management was met with little political resistance, as most citizens saw it as a new hope for a Late Industrialist utopia. The new global government was built around the ideas of equality, government-provided welfare, and a republican governmental system.\u0000css\n    With the globe underneath it, the new government began looking to the stars, and by -35 it had placed its first simple satellites in orbit. With what primitive mechanical calculations they had, they operated relatively efficiently. As the public's eyes were turned towards the stars as well, with promises of immense resources and prosperity, their field of space travel advanced very quickly (when compared to other homeworlds) bringing unparalleled prosperity to their star system. Each year, more and more resources were devoted to space exploration, establishing bases across the star system of [!3 Gavia] and landing a human on the neighboring planet [!4 Norlia] by the year -32. Since Norlia was so similar to Gallea, in its environment and temperature, it was discovered (based on samples) that some places on the surface of the planet would be able used to grow hardier Gallean plants with little modification. In the year -29, another mission was sent, the theory about growing plants was tested, and found to be true. Upon discovery that farmland was viable on the surface of another planet, the planetary government built a colony ship, promising vast swaths of land and prosperity for anyone willing to start a new life on Norlia. In the year -27, the first permanent colony was established on Norlia.\u0000css\n    As the Gallean race became a multiplanetary species, they needed to create infrastructure to keep multiple planets in communication. They developed radio systems using massive radio dishes, that can be turned and pointed at any target to communicate with them. Some curious Galleats pointed dishes towards nearby stars with unusually-high amounts of radio noise, hoping that they could decipher something from the static, and maybe even confirm other forms of life. The starbound dishes didn't yield much until in the year -8, when they received a clear, intentional message from 9 light years away. The message was sent from a local star, [!5 Simia]. The message came from the planet [!6 Deoria], and the Galleans immediately replied. This transmission was one of the first of [!7 The Great Contact]. As soon as the transmission from the Deorians was confirmed, it was taken by the government, and transmitted to every TV, radio, house, and business as breaking news. Gallea maintained contact with Deoria, and later [!8 Itascus], over the next decade, but without any sort of translation, the raw audio transmissions were nearly useless.\n\n    An Itascan envoy visited in the year 1, and gifted the gallean race the materials and instructions to build a [!9 warp drive], along with other technologies, as part of [!10 The Warp Endowment Campaign]. After training competent translators for the languages of other worlds, they met with the other planetary leaders in the year 10 and became a founding member of the GUN. To their surprise, they realized many other planets and forms of life were quite different from them. They searched endlessly for an icy planet in their observatories and with what few warp-capable scouts they had, not finding much besides icy moons of gas giants. They started to realize just how lucky they were to originate in a system with two habitable planets. Over the course of their search, they became more acquainted with galactic life and commerce.\u0000css\n    After discovering a potentially suitable planet 13 light years away in the year 41, they sent a warp scout and confirmed via landing crew that this planet might also be capable of supporting Gallean life, with a bit of terraforming, that is. This new planet was [!11 Zerania], and the Gallean government realized that they would need many more warp-capable ships in order to reasonably colonize the new world. The Government opted to start a program; seeing that their moon, Ganeimede, had useable amounts of Helium-3 on its surface, which is used in the production of warp cores. Zerania was successfully colonized in the year 47.\n\n    After [!12 The Ganeimedic Rebellion], Gallean command and government were thrown into chaos, feelings of inferiority and failure spread throughout the homeworld, as well as the other colonies. This anxiety marked the beginning of the Armament Era, lasting from 47 to 68. A deep fear was instilled in the Gallean people; in the wake of the loss of the moon of their own homeworld, it became a popular belief that the Gallean nation was gravely under equipped for extraterrestrial combat. This era was seen as one of technological progress. However, the era had its grim aspects; combat training was taught in schools, military technology was prioritized over many other programs, and the army of Gallea swelled with recruits. [!13 Personal weaponry] was legalized and licensed for use in self-defense, and in case a foreign power were to invade the planet. Their relationships noticeably soured with foreign powers, feeling betrayed by the other nations that acted against them in the rebellion of their moon. During the Armament Era, many Galleats feared that it was likely that a foreign power would see their nation as weak, and decide to invade. Although largely unjustified, these fears became deeply rooted in Galleat society. This era also saw the construction of planet-wide and orbital defenses around and on Gallean planets.\u0000css\n    The societal changes from Armament Era were challenged in the late 60s, as Galleats that were infants during the loss of their moon aged into maturity and became influential citizens. This was also due to no major conflicts occuring that could justify such a large military stockpile. Newer ideas of free trade and disarmament became popular throughout the colonies and homeworld. This movement was known as the “Rationalist Uprising”. Being mostly peaceful, they elected rationalist leaders into office, officially declaring the “irrational era” over in 68. The movement embraced the fields of technological research. The research was no longer for war, but for the advancement of all sentient species; developments that were previously created for military use were shared publicly, spreading to the rest of the GUN, developments such as advanced computation electronics used for ballistics. Gallean military enlistments plummeted as enlisting was seen as foolish, and the army deflated into very small numbers. This left only the most trained, and extremely professional fighting forces as the nation's military. The military itself was still supported by rationalists, but only for rare uses of professional soldiers as opposed to conscripts. The rationalist era is marked as spanning from the year 68 to the year 78.\n\n    The rationalist era ended slowly as the once strong, uniform movement splintered into smaller and more specific parties. However, Gallean society as a whole agreed it was in the best interest to restructure the government into a new socialist republic, where the Senate was the supreme body of governance, and the government provided all needed aid to its citizens. And its citizens, in turn, would provide all the needed work for their government. This continued on as parties continued to fracture, eventually leaving political alignment to be defined by a “Rationalist Spectrum”.\u0000css\n    This marked the beginning of the Stable Era, sometimes called the ‘Relaxed' period of Gallean history. Political movements became comparatively moderate. Even the professional army was content. The economy was adequately stabilized using a combination of Socialism and Capitalism to run its markets. This era spanned from the year 79 to the present, as Galleans have more-or-less maintained status quo and kept equity among its citizens. Though one aspect of Gallean culture has broken the stagnation, the computing industry. Many international tech companies have offices on Gallea as a result. The small, but modern, military polices the streets and trade routes with a combination of drones & surveillance algorithms. As of now, the nation is in its most peaceful period.",

This weapon has an effective range of 1.8 kilometers when equipped with its long range scope (for which it has a Medium Rail mount on the top of the barrel).  It handles smoothly, but must be fired from a prone position.  If fired from the upright position, it could cause breakage of the shoulder or loss of balance due to the power of the rifle. This weapon is more for use against military equipment rather than military combatants.  However, it can be used for both.\n\n    Brand new, this weapon runs on the market for about $8500.  On the civilian after-market, the gun costs more around $7000.  The price of the military-grade scope does not factor into these figures.\n\n       This weapon was created as an experimental anti-material military sniper rifle by the Tuine Government. It was considered, in its early years of creation, to be one of the best anti-vehicle weapons due to its effective range and stopping power.  This weapon was extremely monitored by the Tuine government and was not allowed in civilian hands.  A few years after its creation, other military forces on major planets began to develop a similar breed of anti-material sniper rifles.  Today, most governments regulate these rifles for military use only. Though there are exceptions for planets like Itascus. Itascus, having practically no laws on gun control, have this available on the civilian market, which stands as the easiest way to purchase one.",

It is currently lacking a standard definition for weapon modifications]\n\n    There are two common types of connectors for weapon addons: Rail Mounts and Barrel Mounts\n\n    Rail Mounts come in three common sizes, Small (S), Medium (M), and Big (L).  The varying sizes are for different types of addons.  For example, smaller rails are used for smaller addons (like laser pointers or flashlights), while larger rails are for things like scopes, which weigh more.  Rail mounts are usually placed on the top of a weapon (for use with sights), but are occasionally placed on the bottom or side (for laser points or grips).\n    Many rail mounts are able to support multiple addon sizes with a single rail. (Ex: a weapon may have an \"ML\" rail, meaning it can connect to medium and large addons)  Some weapons have nonstandard railmounts, usually designed for nonstandard addons, and are not compatible with standard pieces.\n\n    Barrel Mounts are screw-on or latch-on connectors on the ends of the barrels of weapons.  Due to the large variety of barrel sizes, there are no standard measurements for barrel connectors.  Instead, barrel connectors (and addons that use them) are labeled using exact measurements (Ex: a silencer that screws onto the end of a 2-centimeter barrel would be labeled \"2cm Barrel Connector\").",

It has a shorter barrel and a sleek design, often adorned with some sort of delicate engraving.  While the .38 Myh' is able to get shots off faster than the [!1 9mm pistol], it's short in its ability to pack a punch and stay accurate.  It is primarily used in closer range situation or used to quickly take out a threat.  It has a maximum effective range of 137.16 meters, which is less than the average pistol.\n\n    It costs about $350 dollars when bought from a distributor, and its price only drops to an average of $300 when bought on the civilian aftermarket.\n\n    This gun was originally manufactured on Bius Tu as an alternative to the more bulky 9mm pistol.  The engravings on the weapon were more for aesthetic purpose but, soon became a signature of the weapon's design, and as an allure to the Tuine public. Some planets have made similar versions of this weapon, however, they have low popularity as they are seen as just a weaker version of a 9mm pistol.  Today, it's not really used for anything besides self-defense.  It's design makes it slightly more concealable than other pistols despite it being generally considered weaker than other pistols out on the market.",

The bullets of this weapon are intended to be non-lethal and are [!1 made of rubber].  However if shot point blank, or misused, this weapon can cause major injury or death.\n\nThis gun was first prototyped around 15 P.W. during the [!2 Itascan World War] as a “non-lethal” solution to quelling riots.  Unfortunately, as a prototype, it ended up having approximately a 50% mortality rate.  The [!3 Itascan Government] ended up making the weapon standard for swat and riot police in 17 p.w, but the weapon still had approximately 35% mortality rate.  Today, after the diffusion of the weapon type to other planets, the model has improved dramatically to only a 20% mortality rate. It is now considered as standard riot police gear on most planets.  Though, more commonly in non-police use, this weapon is now used with normal, non-rubber rounds.\n\nSpecial Information:\n    Weapon has a 4/20 chance to functionally convert rubber pellets into normal pellets.",

It has a medium length barrel and can fire unusually-powerful rounds.  In unskilled hands, the weapon can be harder to use due to its recoil, despite being outfitted with a gas-compressed recoil system to compensate. The gun itself handles rather smoothly but requires upkeep far more often than most pistols. This weapon is bulkier than other pistols so it is far less easy to conceal or use in a stealthy fashion. \n\n    This gun costs about $700-$850 on the common market.  The gold variant costs $1500 to $2000.  Sale of the gold variant is frowned upon, as it was only intended for use by the [!1 presidents of Itascus].\n\n    This gun was invented under orders of the Itascan president [!2 Kyle Stanley], who needed a pistol to “really make a statement”.  For the time, this weapon was considered a marvel of engineering by the Itascans.  They were able to create modifications to the gas-compressed recoil system invented by the Tuines.  It came into common use by select military units during the [!3 Itascan World War], and soon was opened to the consumer market.  This pistol has become a symbol of Itascus, as each president since Kyle Stanley has carried one with a golden chassis, and has thus earned the rather comical nickname “Itascan Peacemaker”. Today, the gun is still used by many planets, primarily in [!4 Itascus].  While the gas-compressed recoil system is harder to maintain, many people favor this weapon for its superior stopping power as a pistol.",

It works by halting the user's menstrual cycle, rendering conception impossible in all currently-known human species, and most known animal species as well.  Ferilin dissolves very easily in water, making fluids an effective medium of application.\n\n    In ancient times, Ferilin was derived from certain plants on [!1 La'Foy] which were thought to be [!2 magical] in the nature of their effects.  While, in reality, the useful effects of the plants were actually achieved through chemical means.  In the late 20s, Ferilin was discovered to be derivable from simple chemical processes, making it producible on the large scale.  This ease of production is credited as the reason why Ferilin is cheap enough (to produce) that it was able to be deployed large-scale on [!3 Armalai].\u0000css\n    Ferilin can be potentially problematic when consumed in large quantities.  When overdosing on Ferilin, a user's physical body will cease to grow.  This does not mean that the user will \"stay young forever\", or much less become immortal; the user will still age and expire naturally.  An overdose simply means that the user will cease to develop, stunting their growth.  Save for drowning in it, there is currently no known way to fatally overdose on Ferilin.",

If the user is of a species that has visible pupils (pupils visually discernable from the user's corneas), they will likely be made to appear very small as the corneas relax.  If someone recieves a fatal overdose of Theracaine, they will stop standing and may even fall unconscious.  At this point, the user will become unresponsive.  After this, the user's breaths will become progressively more shallow until breathing stops entirely.  The recipient of the fatal dose will expire from suffocation within minutes after they have succumb to respiratory depression.",

They were invented by a [!1 Tuine] military contractor in the year 32 as a tool to immediatly stop bleeding from combat-related wounds.  Packer Shots contain a moderate dose of [!2 Theracaine] to numb the typically-extreme pain of wounds gained through combat.  Specifically, Packer Shots are used to temporarily close bullet wounds.\u0000css\n    A standard packer shot consists of a seven-centimeter-long, one-centimeter-wide metal or hard plastic cylinder.  On the side of the cylinder is a tall button along the edge.  Inside the cylinder is a pellet of condensed fibers connected to a spring-loaded piston.  When the button is pressed, the spring is released, ejecting the fiber pellet into whatever is immediately in front of the opening on the cylinder.  Within the pellet is two chemicals: The first is a 150mg dose of Theracaine to numb the wound, and the second is reactive foam chemical.  This foam chemical, when making contact with a water-containing substance (such as blood), quickly expands and hardens.  The use of this foam is intended to immediately stop bleeding.  The pellet itself, when not expanded, is a cylinder which is almost one centimeter in diameter and three centimeters in height.  The pellet is specifically compacted to expand in the plane perpendicular to the axis through which it was inserted.  Packer shots come with a small elastic cap over the opening to keep the active chemicals from coming into contact with water when not in use.  This cap is meant to be removed before the packer pellet is applied.\n    \n    A Packer Shot is only a temporary solution to an injury.  If the wound was caused by a [!3 Ballistic weapon], a packer shot will not remove the bullet, it will simply be layered over it.  Wounds should not be allowed to heal around a Packer Shot Pellet, as this would create a permanent opening in the flesh.  After application, the recipient of a packer shot should see a physician at their earliest convenience to have the bullet removed and the wound dressed.",

A Qi entity only exists as long as the charged Qi particles within it remain contained and remain charged. \n    \n    Qi Entites have a homogenity property, meaning that all charged Qi particles within have the same spin, allignment, and \"Qi heat\".  The \"Qi heat\" describes the speed at which the entity's Qi particles move within the entity.  All three of these properties determine the entity's \"function\".  The entity's function determines how the entity acts, and some functions can be very useful.\n\n    On top of having different functions, Qi Entities can have physical protrusions called \"links\".  These Links can connect to nearby Qi Entities, binding them, and allowing them to influence one another.  Collections of Qi Entites bound together are called Qi Structures.\n    \n    Linking Qi Entities to create structures, combined with setting Qi Entity functions, results in a useful craft called Qi Invocation/Qi Programming, though some older circles still refer to this as \"spellcasting\"/\"enchanting\" or simply \"magic\".\u0000css\n    A Qi Entity, given time, will naturally dissipate and cease to exist as the charged, energy-baring particles within it either escape or naturally discharge.  Though, Qi Entities manifesting in solids last thousands of times longer than those mainifesting in fluids (such as water or air).  This is thought to be because a Qi Entity in a fluid, which naturally attempts to maintain a spherical shape, is constantly being subjected to small currents which whisk off a small amount of qi-containing material.  For example, if a Qi Entity was created and manifested in air, it would be pushed around the environment by air currents.  But this is not what causes the energy loss; the loss is caused by fluid currents within the entity pushing Qi-manifested material out of the sphere (therefore discharging the particles and losing the energy) and pulling non-Qi-containing material into the entity's sphere.  Eventually, this causes a total loss of energy in the entity, causing it to dissolve.  Entities manifesting in solids do not have this problem (more accurately, the extent to which they have this problem is negligable).  Instead, Qi Entities in solids dissipate through the natural decay of the charged Qi particles within them (into uncharged Qi particles).\n    \n    Since Qi entities are a component of all known human species' anatomies, most people can produce a programmable Qi Entity from their own body.  These Qi Entities can be reprogrammed to perform a function different than the one it performed while in their body.  They can then be used to make complex Qi Structures.  Though, the act of pulling a Qi Entity out of one's own body is a difficult skill to learn, as it's not something humans are supposed to naturally do.  Despite this, some people spend years of their lives studying and training themselves to be able to extract Qi Entities from thier bodies so that they can perform Qi Invocation without the assistance of a tool.",

They are then able to use the Qi Entities they extract from themselves to manually construct spells.\n    Conjurers require no external hardware to summon Qi Entities for spellcraft.  Instead, they have enchanted a part of their own body (usually the hand) so that they can use it as a tool to cast spells with.  Functionally, Conjuring is the same as Assembling, with the the difference being whether they use their own body as a spellcasting tool or not.",

Due to the loss of nearly 45% of the Counterintelligence and Espionage Field Agents based on [!4 Itascus] during the war, the departments were in serious need of new agents to fill the empty positions.  So Alexi put in place the Early Bird Espionage Program. \n    \n    The program focused on children from around the ages of 6-10 who showed heightened physical and/or intellectual prowess in [!5 Primary School] and train them to be Counterintelligence or Espionage Field Agents.  These children would be moved into special schooling environment and taught, from then on, in the arts of coercion and espionage.  The Program was able to produce hyper-specialized, excellently-trained Field Agents of young adult age within 10-12 years.  This also meant that, since they were so young, they could serve for their assorted agencies for longer than individuals who entered as adults.  After the war, this program produced many Field agents and Spies that were then tasked with gathering intel and information.  This Program proved to be advantageous for the national departments, so it continued up until the year 108 P.W. when the GCP was reformed.",

This specific anxiety disorder was originally thought to be a subclassification of Agoraphobia —— an anxiety disorder in which people fear and avoid places or situations that might cause them to feel like they're helpless or unable to escape.  More recently, the condition has been found to be at least partially psychosomatic.  People with SpAD often experience panic attacks where they begin to lose attachment to reality, believing they are about to die to the endless vacuum of space. \n\n    This type of anxiety disorder is usually triggered by the use/prospective use of space craft and interplanetary travel, however, as most citizens of the [!2 GCP] don't utilize space travel there are significantly fewer incidences of SpAD than there would be otherwise. In a recent survey conducted by the IPC, less than 1% of people with SpAD continue to make regular interplanetary trips after initial diagnosis. The most common medicine prescribed to treat SpAD is [!3 Visage], less often referred to by its active ingredient, [!4 Hyporezide].\u0000css\n    People with SpAD often have at least a few of the following symptoms:\n\n        - Crippling sense of impending doom or danger\n        - Shortness of breath/trouble breathing\n        - Nausea\n        - Chest pain\n        - Chronic migraines\n        - Vertigo\n        - Passing out\n        - Tingling sensation in extremities\n        - Uncontrollable feelings of spinning or floating, even if standing still or laying down\n        - Detachment from reality",

        "data": "css\n    Cascading Branch Networking Protocol is a Machine Networking Protocol used throughout the [!1 GCP].  It is used to transfer data between connected computers, and can even be used between computers on different planets.\n    \n    A CBNP network is a layered network.  Every connected machine/router in the network is connected to a single machine/router.  The router the device connects to is considered one layer \"above\" the device, and all devices that connect thought -it- are considered a layer \"below\".  Every device has a single 8-bit routing number (ranging from 1 to 254) assigned to it by the router above it or manually.  No two devices connected to the same router on the layer above can have the same routing address, as this would cause problems.\n    When data is sent over a CBNP network, it first travels \"up\" the network by a certain number of layers.  This is called the \"ascent\" stage.  After that the data packet enters the \"decent\" stage.  Within the address is a list of the routing numbers of every router on the way down to the recipient device, ending with the recipient's routing number followed by zero (since routing numbers can't be zero, this defines the end of the address).\n    CBNP has two addressing modes: Relative and Absolute.  In Relative Addressing, the \"ascent\" stage lasts for a specified number of layers before it decends.  In Absolute Addressing, the packet ascends all the way to the router at the highest layer on the network, called the \"head router\", before it decends.  For CBNP addresses using Absolute Addressing, the number of layers the packet needs to ascend before decending is set to 255.\u0000css\n    \n    The following is a diagram of a CBNP network:\n    \n                    X[N/A]\n                    |\n        +-----------+-+--------------+\n        |             |              |\n        A[3A]         B[42]          C[8F]\n        |                            |\n  +-----+-----+                +-----+-----+\n  |           |                |     |     |\n  D[05]       E[C8]            F[FD] G[62] H[B9]\n              |                      |\n        +-----+-----+                |\n        |     |     |                |\n        I[01] J[02] K[03]            L[01]\n        \n    In this diagram, each letter (A through L) is a device/router on the network.  The 'X' at the top is the head router.  Next to each letter is the machines routing number.  As an example, if machine 'J' in the diagram wants to send something to machine 'G' (using Absolute Addressing), it would use the address \"FF-8F-B9-00\".  The \"FF\" is 255 in decimal, and tells the routers above it to carry the packet all the way up to the head router ('X').  After that, the head router reads the second number, \"8F\", and sends it to the router below it with the routing number of 8F (which is machine 'C').  Then, machine 'C' reads the next number, 'B9', and sends it to the machine under it with the routing number 'B9', which is machine 'H'.  Machine 'H' gets the packet and reads the next number as '00', and then machine 'H' knows that the packet is intended for it, and accepts it.\n    For a real-world example, let's imagine that devices 'F' and 'J' are a [!2 telephones].  The user of telephone 'F' wishes to call telephone 'E', so they dial \"FF-3A-C8-02-00\".  The first number will bring the packet up to the Head Router 'X', the second down to the router 'A', the third to router 'E', and the final number '00' terminates the decent.\u0000css\n    Cascading Branch Networking Protocol uses collections of bytes (that can be transferred over a network) called packets.  Packets can vary greatly in size, being anywhere from under 100 bytes to 64 Kibibytes in total.  A CBNP packet consists of Five sections, which are the following (in order):\n        \n        Header Section\n        Recipient Address Section\n        Data Section\n        Return Address Section\n\n    Header Section:\n        The first two bytes of the header section are the values \"55\" and \"AA\" for a sort of integrity check\n        The third byte is the length (in bytes) of the address, including the terminator.\n        The fourth and fifth bytes are a 16-bit number describing the \"channel\", which is used to identify what type of traffic the packet is for (ex: phone call, web browsing, file transfer).\n        The sixth and seventh bytes are a 16-bit number describing the size of the Data Section (in bytes)\n        The ninth byte is a number representing which routing number in the address is the next routing number to use as the packet 'decends'.  This number is called the \"Address Offset Byte\" (If this number is zero, it means the packet is in the 'ascent' stage.  If the number is nonzero, it means the packet is in the 'decent' stage.)\n    \n    The Recipient Address Section contains the recipient's CBNP address, with each number being one byte\n        If the packet is in the 'accent' stage, the first byte of the recipient's address (the counter for how many layers to 'ascend') is decremented.  If this decrement results in the number being zero (meaning the packet has reached the end of its 'ascent'), then the Address Offset Byte is set to \"1\", marking the start of the 'decent' stage.  If the router handling the packet is a Head Router, it will unconditionally begin the 'decent' stage.\u0000css\n    The Data Section is the data contained within the packet meant to be delivered to the recipient\n    \n    The Return Address Section contains the return address and is constructed during transit\n        The first byte is the length of the return address (in bytes)\n        The rest of the Return Address Section is the return address\n        \n        During the 'ascent' stage, each router that the packet travels through adds its router number to the end of the return address.  It also increments the byte describing the size of the return address.\n        Once the packet ends the 'ascent' stage, the router handling it appends the return address with '00', terminating it.\n        For every layer the packet passes through in the 'decent' stage, the router it's passing through increments the byte representing the number of layers the return address should 'ascend'.\u0000css\n    As an example, lets say we wanted to send the numbers zero through seven in a packet from machine 'H' in the previous diagram (absolute address: \"FF-8F-B9-00\") to machine 'K' (absolute address: \"FF-3A-C8-03-00\").  For the purpose of this example, let's say the Channel being used is \"ABCD\".\n    \n    When the packet is first sent, the bytes making it up will look like the following:\n    \n55 AA 04 AB CD 00 08 00 FF 3A C8 03 00\n└────────Header───────┘ └───Address──┘\n\n00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00\n└─────────Data────────┘ └┴─Return Address\n\n    By the time the packet reaches the recipient, it will be the following:\n    \n55 AA 04 AB CD 00 08 04 FD 3A C8 03 00\n└────────Header───────┘ └───Address──┘\n\n00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 04 03 8F B9 00\n└─────────Data────────┘ └─Ret.

Wiron is made for shock absorption in armor plating.  Because of the low content of Carbon used in the Steel (%1), the alloy is more ductile as opposed to brittle, and will not become a dangerous projectile itself when impacted.\n\n    Due to the high density of the Uranium in the alloy, the metal can easily absorb the kinetic energy of a bullet ( according to the fundamental principles of dynamics: The sum of all external forces applied to a system divided by its mass gives its instantaneous acceleration, so a greater mass leads to lower acceleration).\n\n    All of these factors make Wiron a very useful alloy for protection of military assets.  But, Wiron has a considerable downside; it remains expensive to manufacture and ship, and is too heavy for some applications (for example, if Wiron used to plate a ship, it will greatly decrease the craft's fuel efficiency).",

The traffic of the space station can be divided into three categories, constructed ships leaving the station, transfer of personnel, and supply shipments.\n\n    The station itself has four distinct sections: the Core, the Docking Bay, the Shipyard, and the Rings. \n    \"The Rings\" is a collection of four [!2 Gravity Rings] stacked on each others' axes.  Each ring is 100 meters in diameter and 9 meters in width.  Each ring in the array rotates opposite of its neighbor(s) for stability.  The rings hold living spaces, recreational spaces, and office spaces.  Each ring is tuned to produce 1.04 Gs.\u0000css\n    The Docking Bay is 32-meter long cylinder at 4-meters in diameter and is connected at either end to the Rings and the Core.  It has eight [!3 Type-A Docking Ports] for transport ships and four [!4 Type-C Docking Ports] for cargo.   \n    The Core is the the center hub of the space station, and contains the stations nuclear generator, life support systems, and storage. \n    The last section of the station is the Shipyard.  The Shipyard is a large, cylindrical, scaffold-esque tube which is connected to The Core at one end and open at the other.  The scaffold is 330 meters long and 60 meters in diameter.  The shipyard is made up of two sections: the manufacturing section and the assembly section.  The manufacturing section is used to physically construct spaceship parts, and the assembly section is where those parts are assembled into spacecraft.  Notably, this structure has four [!5 manipulator arms] used in ship construction.\n    In total, the station is 472 meters long and has a diameter of 60 meters (diameter discounting the gravity rings).  The Molokai Station is capable of building ships up to 200 meters long.\n    \n    Life on the station is dictated by the quality standards of Exospace, the living standards are high but, but work standards set by the organization are strict, and have been reported to be unusually stressful to both higher managers and construction workers.",

Ferrotapes come in many shapes, sizes, and storage amounts, and have been invented independently on many worlds in ancient times.\n\n    Typically, Ferrotapes can store anywhere between 4 and 256 Kibibytes.  Tapes are able to be made at higher data densities, but higher densities of tape are found to be more prone to corruption or simple data rot.  Individual Ferrotapes have a read/write speed of ~4.2 Kibibytes per second.\n\n    The cases of Ferrotapes are most commonly metal, but are ocassionally made of other materials such as enamel or plastics.  Inside of this case is two (or more) spools holding the lengths of magnetic tape on which the tape's data is stored.\n\n   Accessing and manipulating the data is done using a piece of hardware called a Tape Reader, Tape Drive, or Ferrotape Drive.  In this drive is a small piece of hardware called a reader/writer head.  This head rests against part of the tape's case at which the tape is exposed.  The reader head can then read the data on that position of the tape, or write data to the tape in the form of magnetism, effectively reading or writing with the disk.  The Tape Drive selects which point on the tape its reading by rotating the tape's spools, which moves the length of tape.\n\n    There are many common dimensions for tape drives across the [!1 GCP].  The following are a few common dimensions:\n        10x6x1 cm - 4KiB to 64KiB\n        16x10x2 cm - 8KiB to 256KiB\n        5x4x2 cm - 2KiB to 32KiB\n\n    Tapes 5x4x2 cm or smaller are considered \"Microtapes\".",

The Tapedeck has a controller that manages every reader head within the Tapedeck, treating them as one large, singular data volume.  The number of Ferrotapes in a Tapedeck is usually a power of two (Ex: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32).\n\n    Tapedecks are able to attain read/write speeds several times that of an individual Ferrotape.  This is because Tapedecks spread their data across all of the tapes within them.  The Tapedeck makes use of this because it means it will take a fraction of the time to read/write every individual byte.  For example, if a Tapedeck has 4 Ferrotapes in its array, it will access data 4 times faster (16.8KiB/s) faster than an individual tape (4.2KiB/s).  Usually, all the tapes within a Tapedeck need to be the same storage size.\n\n    There are two configurations of Tapedeck: Swappable and Non-Swappable.  Non-Swappable Tapedecks have cases that are not intended to be opened, and are not made to be maintained.  Swappable Tapedecks are able to be opened, and have the individual tapes within them replaced.  Though, before removing a tape from the array, it's suggested that a user \"reshuffles\" the data on the Tapedeck to render the soon-to-be-removed tape unused.  The user can then safely remove the tape from the deck.  If the user then replaces the tape with another, the user should then \"reshuffle\" the data in the deck again to make use of the new tape.\n\n    Some Tapedecks are made with a \"multidrive\" setting, where the Tapedeck can dynamically make multiple logical data volumes out of specific tapes, up to the number of tapes in the deck.  This is also achievable by special software.",

Known since the dawn of the [!2 Itascan race], the moon has always had a important place in Itascan mythology, being associated with war and power.\n\n    The red surface is mainly composed of mountains, valleys, and gigantic continental plateaus.  Surprisingly, Ice is found on the highest mountain caps of the moon, despite with the relative warmth of the planet.\n\n    Towns and places established after the year 62 have been constructed and placed underground.  This is for two reasons: allowing for the exposed land to be used for farmland, and making Urran homes and buildings more difficult to invade.  The population in these newer areas, which make up almost a third of the developed areas on the planet, have their houses underground.  There are even entire small towns on Urra constructed completely below ground, with only a handful of (fortified) entrances. \n\n    The planet is one of the main producers of food across the GCP thanks to a naturally fertile soil (for most plants in the [!3 Itaus] vivotype) and resting at a perfect temperature for agriculture.  The small axial tilt of the planet is also advantageous, guaranteeing a constant temperature across the year.  Planetary Urra has fueled interplanetary commerce through their export of valuable food and import of nitrates (organic waste) to supplement their fertilizer supply.\u0000css\n    Even though Urra's industrial sector is small, the Urran industrial complex's has been skyrocketing since the completion of [!4 the planet's mass relay], the cheaper access to space, and the abundance of valuable resources attracting international companies.\n\n    Urra's [!5 Time Table String] is heavily based off that of [!6 Itascus], and is \"N-20:00T ZT 1Y/12L/12D/40T/40d\".

Habiuetine was branded as Cisvatic in the year 70, after lengthy medical trials beginning in 65 which concluded that Habiuetine was a safe treatment for many long-term stress disorders.  However, after the regulation of Habiuetine as Cisvatic, the potency of branded Habiuetine was decreased dramatically and black market dealers began to profit on the success of their new highly addictive street drug [!4 Spirit Honey].\n\n    Habiuetine's raw materials can be found on most planets naturally, and is manufactured using chemical synthesis.  Habiuetine should not be combined with other depressants.\u0000css\n    Habiuetine, in its pure form, is a known depressant used to soothe stress, anxiety, depression, and some eating disorders.  Side effects of Habiuetine may include drowsiness, loss of appetite, and minor loss of motor control.  Symptoms of withdrawal from Habiuetine have been observed to occur after halting intake of the substance after a one month period of constant use.  The withdrawal symptoms (at this level) have not been shown to be fatal.  However, 1 in 10 users of Habiuetine who did not experience a stress disorder before taking Habiuetine developed a trauma-related stress disorder after sudden discontinuation of the substance.\n\n    The signs of a moderate overdose cannot be detected until at least 14 hours after the intake of 24mg per kilogram of the user's mass.  A moderate overdose is physically unpleasant, with the first symptom to occur being a large, dry, flaky, and itchy rash on limbs, which will progress to dizziness followed by fainting.  The psychological effects of an overdose will leave a user feeling euphoric and impulsive, yet further use of Habiuetine before it has cleared a user's system could lead to a fatal overdose.\n    The fatal dose of Habiuetine is around 60mg, and can be detected very soon after ingestion.  The user's perceived euphoria becomes overpowering, there is a slow onset of complete numbness, complete loss of motor control, and, if a rash is present from the moderate overdose, it will begin to blister.  There are only preventative actions to be taken against a fatal overdose, otherwise, death is imminent within 14 hours.  The user, after a fatal overdose, will likely encounter seizures and finally succumb to cardiac toxicity.",

Cisvatic is commonly used to treat long-term stress disorders.  Commonly, it's known to have a soothing affect on its users, and is usually prescribed to be administered as needed, although a user is advised not to ingest more than three doses within a 20 hour period.  Cisvatic may cause drowsiness.\n\n    Cisvatic is ingested in small gel capsules with liquid centers which are intended to be swallowed whole.  The gel capsules come in red and are printed with the label \"ICP-CIS\" in white.  A prescription bottle of Cisvatic contains, on average, 30 capsules.",

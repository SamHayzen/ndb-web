The Deorian specimen is bipedal, with B-Type bodies.  Deorians are covered in body fur, with colors ranging from crimson to cyan (fur color is determined by genetic factors).  In addition to their body fur, Deorians have longer hairs growing from their heads and tailbones, giving the appearance of common hair and tails.  The color of these longer hairs are typically a darker shade of their body fur tone.  These hairs are thicker and longer than the hairs of their body fur.  Deorian tails consist of no flesh or bone, simply being a long bundle of hairs stemming from their lowermost parts of their backs.\u0000css\n    Like all known species of human, Deorians heavily rely on unique facial structures to identify others.  Compared to other species, the face of a Deorian is notably unique.  Like other life of the [!1 Daerus] vivotype, the eyes of the Deorian face are notably large.  While the average diameter of other humans' eyes is two to three centimeters, the adult Deorian eye is five to six centimeters.  Regardless its size, the Deorian eye has a unique appearance.  The Sclera of a Deorian's eyes are light grey, but gradually turn dark brown as age.  The iris color of of the eye can come in about a dozen different, shimmering colors, mostly determined by the ethnicity of the subject.  Most notably, a Deorian's pupil is shaped like a rounded triangle.  The rotation of each eye (meaning the rotation of the triangular pupil) is apparently completely random, determined at conception; even genetically-identical twins are born with different pupil orientations.\n    As for the rest of the face, the mouth and nose are built into a short snout, which is about half the height and width of the face as a whole.  The snout extends four to six centimeters out from the rest of the face, making a sort of muzzle.\u0000css\n    In terms of their overall bodies, Deorians have typical B-Type frames.  Deorians' limbs are of average width and girth, but the muscle bundles are more defined under the skin.  Some scientists think that this detail is due to Deorians coming from a world of moderately-high gravity (1.62 G).  Being of B-Type bodies, their legs have two major joints (as opposed to one); the first one is the forward-facing upper knee, which is just \"the knee\" in F-Type bodies, and the backward-facing lower knee, which is a variant of \"the ankle\" seen in F-Type bodies.  Overall, this divides the leg into three, equal-height sections.  From a side view, the upper-most third of the leg is quite wide, spanning 35 to 43 centimeters front to back (as it's full of muscle), while the lower-most third (right above the foot) is comparatively thin, only about 10 centimeters in diameter.\n\n    Deorians' hands and feet are hoof-like, being made of hard, enamel-like bone.  Deorian hands consist of four free-moving cloves, all of which being opposable, functionally making them relatively undexterous, though unusually powerful, fingers.  All four fingers of an adult Deorian are seven to nine centimeters long.  On average, a Deorian has 600 to 700 newtons of grip strength in each hand.\n    Deorians' feet are structured similarly to their hands.In the foot, three of the cloves extend forward from the \"ankle\" by about 20 centimeters, while the fourth faces backwards to act as a heel.  The clove of the foot which acts as the heel is much wider than the three in front.  Unlike those of the hand, the three cloves making up the fronts of the feet are fused together at the bases.  This makes the foot much stronger, though less dexterous.\u0000css\n    On the tops of their heads, each Deorian has a pair of natural antlers. At birth, these antlers are little more than nubs.  Though these antlers start to grow beginning in adolescence (five to ten [!2 Galactic Years]), and thereafter grow continually until death.  The patterns and shapes of the antlers vary from person to person, predetermined by one's sex, age, and ethnicity.  Tests show that Deorians are genetically coded to connect human identities to antler patterns in the same way they perceive hair.  The antlers of Deorian males can grow to rise between 15 to 50 centimeters above their head, while females' can grow up to 70.  Many Deorians shave down or even shear off their antlers for cultural reasons, convenience, personal choice, or aesthetics.\n    \n    The Deorian species has only moderate sexual polymorphism.  Most notably, female Deorians are, on average, 18 centimeters shorter than males of the same species, 125 to 134 centimeters on average, while males stand at 148 to 157 centimeters.  Conversely, the antlers of a common female Deorian tend to be about 20 centimeters taller than that of a common male.\n    For reproductive reasons, females' waists are slightly wider.  This difference is mostly imperceptible to other human species, but Deorian brains are built to be better at recognizing the difference.  While Deorian males have a shoulders-to-waist ratio of about 7:6, females have a ratio closer to 1:1.  Finally, male snouts extend six centimeters out from the rest of the face, while female snouts only extend four centimeters out on average.\n\n    The Deorians, as a species, have been quite successful.  They are the dominant species on their homeworld of [!3 Deoria], and have traversed endless space to propagate their kind across the stars.",

The state in power wishes to keep its population constant, as evidenced by its [!2 policies on immigration and population control.] Armalai's surface, while naturally barren, is very colorful; typically a collage of reds, oranges, yellows and blues. The city lights of buildings typically consist of the same vibrant colors, brightly visible from orbit, making the planet seem to sparkle when viewed from the dark side. In recent years, a few bodies of water have started to appear in low lying areas due to the atmospheric conditioning of the planet over the decades of its inhabitance.\n\n    To decrease the spread of foreign pathogens, and to allow for more efficient record keeping of transactions, foreign spacecraft are only allowed to land in specified areas. These areas are treated as buffer zones, and require proper documentation and [!3 clearance] to leave and enter primary Armalite lands. Capital Square in the capital city, [!4 Lightfire], is a special landing area, used only by very important landing vehicles (such as those of national leaders) and only in specific time frames.\u0000css\n    Armalai has made a reputation for itself as being a prominent source of consumer media of all varieties. Combined, the Armalite industries have a disproportional market share when in comes to consumer media. This is accredited to the planet's swift adoption of [!5 Unil], as most creative material from Armalai is written or produced in the galactic language.\n\n    The Armalite [!6 Time Table String] is \"R-0:00T ZT 1Y/9L/37D/4W/10T/100d\". Armalai's local time system is heavily based on that of its orbital parent, La'Foy, as it was established when Armalai was still a La'foyan colony. But, because Unil has been a popular language on Armalai since its introduction, the Unil names for units of local time were quickly adopted by the population and were officially standardized in the year 89.\n\n    Notably, all tapwater found on Armalai contains a standard dose of [!7 Ferilin] for population control.\u0000css\nThere are three classifications for areas on Armalai:\n      \n    Primary areas:\n        These areas are the entertainment focus on Armalai. They contain things like restaurants, theatres, salons, spas, museums, gift shops and other convenient outlets that tourists would need. Primary areas are typically very stylized and visually appealing.  There are sometimes citizen apparel guidelines for while they are in these areas, though they are not mandatory.  Primary areas are littered with discretely placed humidifiers to keep the air comfortably breathable, as opposed to Armalai's typically-waterless atmosphere.\n    \n    Secondary areas: \n        Secondary areas, informally known as “backstage”, are typically reserved for low rank civilian housing, goods manufacturing, and citizen amenities, such as grocery outlets, doctors' offices, studios, etc. There is a clear distinction between primary, and secondary areas; secondary areas have a severely decreased focus on aesthetics. Secondary areas are by no means unappealing, they are simply appear as any other urban area. There is no regulation on passage between primary and secondary areas, though it is difficult without knowing an area layout; many city planners design roads and zones in a way to silently guide people who aren't intended to visit secondary areas (ex: tourists, news crews, etc.) to stay in Primary ones.\n        \n    Wilderness:\n        Wilderness covers the majority of the body's surface, and consists of dunes, what little farmland Armalai has, and some small bodies of water. For some more developed cities, such as Lightfire, there are short, snugly-fit walls between wilderness and developed areas with doors at regular intervals. There are many potential reasons as to why the walls are built; some say that living next to the open desert can make citizens uncomfortable, the walls make the inside of the city slightly cooler, or that they're simply more aesthetically appealing.",

The planet was not influenced much by the Urran Invasion of 89, being a simple colony. But, since the dissolve of the Urran empire, the colony has fallen into a state of relative disarray.\n\n   Most of the populous on Uterku is spread over the body in small groupings of less than a thousand in small towns commonly referred to as \"communities\" And are almost all self-sustaining. Communities are usually built around natural resources, such as water, forests, or valuable minerals. While communities have everything a civilian would need to survive, they hardly ever have [!2 rocket fields] or [!3 shipyards], meaning that civilians looking for import/export must travel to a local megacity, all of which have space infrastructure.\n\n   Journalists have recorded a few notable developments in the last few months regarding order on the body. Many communities have been observed to be maintaining order and upholding (community-defined) laws. But, these communities prefer to separate themselves from other communities. This combined with their inability to launch ships has led to major isolation.\n\n   Communities have been largely peaceful with one another. This is mainly due to Urra confiscating civilian weapons. But one growing faction, the Grey Styx, has raided the weapons out of many old Urran military bases in the area around the planet's old capitol. The group is believed to have control over at least 50 communities, with no known central headquarters.",

So, Warp Ferries were proposed shortly after the creation of the GUN by the nation that was then known as Ghilly as a cost-effective plan for transportation.\n\n   Warp Ferries work by hosting a great number of docking ports of all types for ships to connect to.

Suits of Power Armor can weigh up to a metric ton. Suits of Power Armor, needing power, have either massive battery banks or compact generators on the back or shoulder. Suits that are not intended for combat may have their power sources on their chests.\n\n   Power Armor spacesuits, due to their lack of powered limbs, are not technically Power Armor. Though, they are still considered such due to the wider range of sensors, and having a very high resilience for a space suit.\n\n   The most popular application of Power Armor throughout time has been combat. Power Armor has proven to be almost indispensable in battle, with its most recent use in large-scale warfare being the [!4 Urran invasion] of [!5 Tyventia]. \n\n\n   There are three common variants of Power Armor: F,B, and Q. Each variant is meant for a certain body type, a user is incapable of properly equipping a suit of Power Armor if it does not match their body type. \n\n   F-Type, standing for \"Front\" or \"Forward\", has front-facing knees. This armor can accommodate users with front-facing knees. These users include, but are not limited to Itascans, Tuines, and Galleates.\n\n   B-Type, standing for \"Back\" or \"Backward\", has front-facing knees. This armor can accommodate users with a rear-facing lower knee, with or without a front-facing upper knee. These users include, but are not limited to La'Foyans and Tyvants.\n\n   Q-Type, standing for \"Quad\" or \"Quadrupedal\", has four legs. This armor can accommodate quadrupedal users, with or without opposable digits. These users include, but are not limited to Deorians.",

The back of the torso opened “like a book”, with two vertical panels opening outward. Both the legs opened in tandem with above panels. The armor was opened via a lever just below the back of the neck Drivers were intended to first reach their arms into the torso and slide them into the arms of the armor, also moving their head into the attached helmet. The driver would then step into the legs to fully dawn the armor. Once the driver was inside, the armor would power on, activating the actuators and allowing the driver to move with the assistance of the actuators. The armor would be closed either by an exterior assistant, or by the driver jutting their arms back to physically shut the doors. A design flaw in Mk. 2 power armor is that drivers found it very difficult to reach the lever on the back to open the power armor themselves, often requiring assistance from someone else.\n\n   The Mk. 2 is where power armor adopted its “bulky” aesthetic, being the apparent thickness modern power armor is today. The surfaces and plates on this version of power armor are smooth and rounded.\n\n   The battery on these suits could last though up to 46 hours of use, being a small improvement over its predecessor.",

Panspermia theory suggests that the similarities between all life is due to a single source of DNA being spread across the galaxy countless years ago. The exact method of which is currently undetermined.\n\nNaturalism \n     Most predominately presented and supported by Entropists. This theorizes that the universe naturally guides life towards a specific form as is simply the nature of things. Whether it's due to life only being able to exist in this form, or the influence of a greater power is debated. This difference, while both still being part of the Naturalist Origin view, has caused a divide in its believers.\n\nInterventionalism \n     The most divine of the three and by far the eldest, Interventionalists are typically from many religious denominations, despite their personal disagreements about the true origin of the world, they all agree that the world was made in image of a higher being that wished for the world to be so. Interventionalist religions are as old as history itself, the idea even spawning independently on isolated worlds.",

In 96PW, a group of hackers made a program called [!1 Colorblind] which allowed CGOS programs to be run on GOS.\n    \n    CGOS was reported to be slower than GOS. This is thought to have been due to the extra stress of producing full-color program windows. CGOS had less WorkRAM available to programs because of the extra memory the OS itself takes up, meaning that more time had to be spent moving running program data to and from memory and the disk more often.\n    \n    Despite its drawbacks, CGOS was still a popular operating system to the public.

The Uudilian skies are mostly clear of clouds; a majority of the water on the planet is frozen in scattered ice sheets.\n     \n     Due to the placement of ice in low, level areas, Uudil is thought to have once had small oceans on its surface millions of years ago. Now, the oceans are deep, comparatively flat ice sheets.\n\n     Uudil was initially a colonization project of the [!1 Itascan] government in 38PW. Itascus sent many warp-capable ships with many kinds of Itascan fauna. No Itascan plant species was able to take to the cold, thin atmosphere of Uudil. The project was abandoned. Later, in 42PW, a private [!2 Galleat] organization brought Galleat fauna to the red planet. They took almost immediately. The fauna spread over the planet like mold on a bun. Due to Galleat fauna's dark coloration, the planet's albedo decreased by over 40% just under two years. This caused a massive heating that killed off most of the plant life. Eventually, the planet settled at a stable temperature, with a stable amount of plant life. Now, the average landscape is the planet's natural deep red, with the occasional grey fern or tuft of grass on the ground.\n\n     Due to its poor atmosphere, many people on the surface commonly have to wear [!3 respirators] of some kind, having a low oxygen content in the air.",

Ghilly is grey-brown, mountainous rocky planet with a thin atmosphere. Ghilly has a very high orbit over its parent, taking up only 0.23 degrees in the Deorian sky.\n\n     Despite its size, Ghilly still has an active geology. This explains its mountainous surface and frequent earthquakes. \n\n     The thin atmosphere of Ghilly means that many people require the use of [!2 respirators] while performing extraneous physical activity. Physical activity in the ambient atmosphere can lead to dizziness, unconsciousness, or even acute Hypoxemia. Most public indoor areas have [!3 Atmosphere Conditioners] to boost the Oxygen content of the air inside.\u0000css\n    Due to the combination of Ghilly's low gravity, frequent earthquakes, and high metal richness, its architecture has taken on a unique style. Most structures are made of primarily iron and steel. Most small/medium structures are suspended between one to even ten or more meters above the ground. Greater heights are more common in more densely developed areas, with some buildings even suspended above others. Buildings are typically suspended by metal spring bar tubes, or other types of suspension from the ground. Most buildings have access stairs or ramps for easy access. Most ramps are from the ground to the base of the building, though for some very tall structures, they're connected between the base and other buildings or common catwalks.\n     \n     Ghilly's [!4 Time Table String] is as follows: \"N-8:00T ZW 1Y/16L/32D/4W/4T/24d/24p\". Ghilly's local time system is almost entirely based on that of Deoria, with the only discrepancy being the number of days in a lunen. Since Ghilly is a lunar world, orbiting another planet, its time system's year is not based on its orbital period. Instead, it's based off the orbital period of its parent, Deoria.",

The revolver is one-of-a-kind as it is encased in a new light weight and heat resistant material; silicone aluminum (SiAl). There revolver itself is a break action handgun with a mounting pin for the battery which has a socket to fit. The entire cartridge battery is rechargeable with eight shots per charge. The wheel holds eight independent capacitor banks and beam emitters that release a laser blast with each pull of the trigger. The revolver is currently priced at $350 for the revolver and one battery cartridge. However, for an additional $15, one can also purchase the charging station made specifically to fit the battery.\n\n     The second generation of the Vega, the MK 2, has a SiAl barrel with better weight distribution, and has universal tactical rail mounts on the top and bottom of the receiver. The rails can be fit with any scope, laser, sight, flashlight, or other modification. This version of the weapon is priced at $380.",

The IASO is run by veterans of multiple branches of the Itascan military, and was intended to help veterans become active in their community by assisting them with getting jobs, housing, and transportation. The IASO reaches out to local businesses and helps staff the businesses with veterans that have skill sets that compliment the position they will fill, and, unlike private staffing companies, the IASO does not charge the businesses for staffing services. \n\n     The IASO also contacts local mass transit agencies to provide passes for veterans that cannot afford them for a reduced fee, and Veteran Passes are to be for veterans only. The IASO also works with local real estate agencies to assist veterans in negotiating a reduced price for their new homes. \n\n     At the time of its creation, the IASO received 5 million Itascan Coins from the Itascan government. However, they were advised that they should consider hosting public events such as barbecues, bingo nights, or movie nights to raise funds of their own, as they will not be issued another grant from the government. The IASO has offices in most every major city, and many large towns on Itascus. The IASO also has an office aboard the [!1 Excelsior.] IASO accepts donations from the general public. Those who submit a donation of $20 of more will receive a handwritten letter from a veteran thanking the donor for their generosity. \n\n     The IASO prints a monthly magazine for those that have bought the monthly donation package, “The Itascan Serviceman”, as it's called, includes war stories, tips from veterans, battlefield breakdowns, a centerfold with upcoming events at their local IASO office, and the latest in (publicly available) military technology, among other war-related media. The organization follows typical Itascan Conservative values. Their motto is: “By the veterans, For the veterans.”",

Deoria is covered in uniformly textured, light-grey mountain ranges spanning and coiling around the planet along every faultline on the surface. Where there aren't long mountain ranges, there are deep blue trenches full of liquid water separating the planet's continents.\n\n     The planet's surface consists of four notable continents, with a few smaller continental areas nestled between them. The four large continents are Milland, Ricefield, Lumbersweep, and Roothome. The four mega continents are arranged in a sort of spherical tetrahedron, each making contact with the other. \n\n     Deoria is now controlled under a single governmental entity, the [!2 Deorian Government]. In ancient Deorian history (before the year 22), there were three global factions. These factions were Polensend, a nation of 532 Million people inhabiting the Milland continent; the UTR, United Townships of Ricefield, a nation of 685 Million people; and Knollstead, a large nation of 1.26 Billion people inhabiting the continents of Lumbersweep and Roothome. These nations have since unified into the Deoria we know today.\u0000css\n    Even though Deoria has its own [!3 local time] system, many Deorian citizens have been observed to use local time and [!4 Galactic Time] interchangeably in daily life. Deoria's Time Table String is \"N-8:00T ZW 1Y/16L/22D/4W/4T/24d/24p\"\n\n     Deoria, as a planet, has notably seen no conflicts with more than 500,000 combatants. The largest conflict on the planet was the [!5 Battle of Jinsed].",

The likelihood of this causing a failure was 11 in 20. After this point, changes were made to the design to reduce this chance to 3 in 20. \n     57  - Crew seats were changed to universal chairs.\n     62  - Selectively replaced some steel components with equivalents made of aluminum, reducing the weight from 16800kg to 15700.\n     76  - Added elastic coating to the inside of the cabin to ward off some of the effects of [!15 Warp Decay]\n     100 - To celebrate the dawn of a new century, the visual design of the ship was altered slightly. The exterior paint was changed from a solid grey to Titanium White, with grey lines between vertical segments. The fuel tank was also recolored to an orange color.",

The firing mechanism is spring-loaded by the bolt. The gun can hold three darts loaded through the top. Rounds begin charging once they enter the chamber (if the safety is off). The weapon has an effective range of ~40 meters in 1G.\n\n    The Stinger's darts are electric capacitors. The tails of the darts have fins to keep them straight during flight. The fronts have pairs of needles, each needle connected to a terminal on the capacitor. The needles are made long and sharp, as they're made to be able to pierce through armor. In some variants of the darts, the needles are made with barbs to keep the darts from falling out of their targets. \n\n    Despite the fact that Stingers are made by various manufacturers, darts are usually uniform in their dimensions to allow for better compatibility. The rear fins are 6cm long, 1mm thick, and usually around 1.5 cm wide. The main body of the dart, the capacitor, is 11cm long. The needles at the end of the dart are usually between 2cm and 6cm long. The dart is 1.75cm in radius. The weapon itself costs $225, while darts individually cost $15.\n\nSpecial Information:\n Darts have 18/20 chance to pierce light armor\n Darts do not damage armor\n Darts have a 14/20 chance to ‘kill' electric targets\n Darts stun organic targets for 3-9 seconds",

La'Foy's botanic features are placed in long streaks along the planet's axis of rotation, meaning forests and wetlands are arranged as if claws of unimaginable scale swept across the land.  Geologically, La'Foy is relatively featureless, as its geology is very inactive (compared to most homeworlds).  The planet's bodies of water, from its rivers to its ocean, are long and winding.\n\n    The largest body of water on La'Foy is the Filuke Sea, which is a long, thin, winding ocean which stretches from 34° latitude to 152° latitude.  In fact, the point where the eastern shore meets the equator marks the Longitudinal Origin for this planet in the [!1 STPS] system.\n    The direct west of the Filuke is peppered with large mountain ranges, being a stark contrast to the red flora surrounding them.  These are called the Congmeishu mountains.\n    To the direct east of the Filuke is the Bovo Great Plains.  On the side of the planet opposite of the Filuke (180° longitude) is the Biu'ngan swamps.\n    At around 120° and 240° longitude are the Bingko and Benko forests respectively.\u0000css\n    La'Foy's atmosphere is very humid.  On average, the air of La'Foy is 3% water vapor by volume.  This has the effect of promoting bacterial growth in most all places on the planet.  Because of this humidity, La'Foy is commonly very foggy in most moderate or low-altitude places, with rain being frequent.\n\n    La'Foy's cities are small but numerous, spread very evenly across the surface.  This, combined with the planet's hazy, fogged atmosphere, makes it appear almost sparkly when viewed from the dark side, with lights being dispersed across the surface.  La'Foy's most populous city is [!2 E'Nera], being the planet's only megacity.",

When two crafts are docked, they are able to transfer resources like power and fuel, and sometimes even crew. Docking port types are usually non-androgynous, meaning that they have positive (extending) and negative (receiving) variants which connect to one another. Space stations and larger craft tend to have an abundance of negative ports, while other ships have positive docking ports for compatibility. When two spacecraft are docked, each is able to read the other's [!1 Callsign] if the ports are connected to a computer system.\n\n     Berthing is the act if joining to craft together permanently or semi-permanently. Berthing ports are much stronger than docking ports, but are considerably more difficult to decouple. Berthing ports have all the functions of docking ports (resource transfer, crew transfer, etc.). When berthing ports are connected, they are deadlocked, and meant to be welded together from the inside. Berthing ports are androgynous and are used in the construction of space stations or larger craft. Newer berthing ports' interiors have panels that can be removed to bridge the two craft/modules, but older or cheaper ports simply have a section of wall marked to be cut and removed.",

This type of gun is more commonly seen in civilian use than in organized military forces. Because of this, the 9mm SMG has gained a reputation for being “urban”, used by some militant factions in the Contested Zones of [!1 Tyventia Prime]. 9mm SMGs tend to sell for $400 to $600 in places where it's legal.\n\n    The 9mm SMG is the natural evolution of the [!2 9mm Pistol], sharing most all of the same mechanisms, and even cross-compatible magazines.

These weapons cost at least $1000 on the market.\n\n    Automatic Shotguns were invented as part of a design competition hosted by [!1 Bius Tu] military complex, looking for a weapon that would be useful in urban warfare and was adaptable enough to take on both heavily armored peers and lightly armored insurgents. The result was the automatic shotgun, which primarily achieved this through the wide variety of ammunition types it could accept.

Small Berthing Ports are not radially locked but are non-androgynous. Small Berthing Ports only allow for transfer of power/fuel and computer system networking.

These nodes are not airtight, and are not meant for bridging the interiors of craft or modules.\n\n     L (Large) Berthing Ports are 60cm in diameter with 4cm-tall lips. Large Berthing Ports are radially locked (at 1/8 rotation intervals) but are androgynous. Large Berthing Ports allow for transfer of fuel, power, computer system networking, and usually crew/cargo. Around the lip of the port are four latches that automatically engage when making contact with another Large Berthing Port. When connected, large berthing ports are first expected to be welded together, then the hull segments within the berthing ports are removed.\n\n     XL (Extra Large) berthing ports are 1.5m in diameter with 6-cm tall lips. Extra Large Berthing Ports are not radially locked not are non-androgynous. Extra Large Berthing ports are used in the construction of large space-fairing structures such as [!1 Space Stations] and very large craft. XL Berthing Ports use electromagnets to better align and couple with one another. Positive XL Berthing Port nodes use positively-charged magnets, and negative nodes use negatively-charged magnets. When coupled, the metal rims of the ports make a full circle of contact to make welding of the nodes easier and more reliable.",

Type-A docking ports are capable of transferring power, fuel, computer networking, and of course, cargo and crew. All variations of Type-A docking ports are 60cm in diameter, and most are non-androgynous. When two Type-A ports are connected, the space between them (within the lips) becomes a buffer zone. Because the all variants' port doors open inward, they will not be able to open if there is significantly lower pressure in the buffer zone. The pressure is equalized using an air valve in the door.\n\n     There are three common variations of Type-A ports:\n          Type-A+, pronounced “Type ‘A' Plus”, or, “Type ‘A' Positive”, is the positive connector variant. Type-A+ docking ports have long probes leading the rim of the docking port, extending 23cm out from the lip. The probe is not integral to docking, it's simply used to assist with alignment. Type-A+ docking ports are able to dock with Type-A- docking ports and are usually found on general spacecraft.\n\n          Type-A-, pronounced “Type ‘A' Minus”, or, “Type ‘A' Negative”, is the negative connector variant. Type-A- docking ports have an inlet for a probe of a Type-A+ docking port in the center. The lip of this inlet extends about 2cm out from the lip of the docking port itself. This is to aid with alignment. Type-A- docking ports are able to dock with Type-A+ and Type-A* docking ports. They are found on [!1 carrier] or [!2 station-class] structures for smaller craft to dock to them.\n\n          Type-A*, pronounced “Type ‘A' Star”, is a special connector variant. The area inside of the lip of the docking port is featureless, sometimes with a viewing port. Type-A* docking ports are designed to be able to dock with Type-A- ports, as well as other Type-A* ports.

While the core tenets of Disterrestrialism are thought to have originated from somewhere else in the galaxy, there are a large number of Disterrestrial communes having stemmed from GCP worlds. Currently, in the GCP, there are four standing communes with over 10,000 members. Ranked from largest to smallest, they're The Order of Exodus, with ~36,000 members; The Order of Paladins, with ~19,000 members; The Order of Scholars, with ~9,000 members; and The Order of Shipwrights, with ~2,800 members.\n\n     Members of this religion collect in communes or groups of communes called orders. The individual communes within an order are called \"sects\", \"abbeys\", or other names, while the lead commune in an order is called a \"convent\", \"monastery\", \"temple\", or another name based on the branch of Disterrestrialism. Due to their nature, these communes are unable to make all of the resources they require. So, each commune has a trade it masters in order to generate revenue, which is then used to purchase resources they cannot generate themselves.\n\n     The core belief of any branch of Disterrestrialism is some variation of the following: \"Life emerged from the cradling comfort of a planet, giving us the warmth and nutrients to expand and grow. But just as we were destined to leave the obscure depths of our oceans, we are destined to leave the cradles of our atmospheres in pursuit of growth and enlightenment in every species.” Disterrestrialist orders are very rigidly structured and well-organized. To maximize their productivity, they attempt to plan out every aspect of their schedules. This applies to both large-scale projects (such as constructing a ship), and small-scale timeframes (such as daily schedules). Each disterrestrialist in a commune has amounts of time allotted for work, meals, leisure, and sleep in each day.",

These latches can only be disengaged by the port's control unit.\n\n     A type-C docking port has a set of double doors that opens inwardly, like a book. The hatch is unlocked by pulling a lever from the inside, but, thanks to their design, they are unable (very difficult) to open when there is significantly higher pressure on the inside of the craft than the outside (i.e., if an operator tries to open the port from within the pressurized cabin while the craft is in a vacuum). Type-C docking ports usually have small glass viewports on one or both of the doors.\n\n     When two craft are docked using type-c ports, the space between the ports acts as a buffer zone. The buffer zone is within the lips of the docking ports. Initially, the buffer zone is a vacuum. The buffer zone can be filled with air using a valve on the door of the port. Once the buffer zone is adequately pressurized (indicating that the seal is airtight, and therefore safe), the port doors can be opened.\n\n      Type-C docking ports were designed and implemented in 53 by the [!1 ISA].

The ring spins around its axis of rotation when powered. When spinning, the ring and everything in it is subject to an outward centripetal force. This force is an adequate substitute for natural gravity, being able to replicate the same strength and properties.\n\n     The torus of a gravity ring is connected to its center by two or more ‘spokes'. One or two of these spokes is a tunnel passage from a zero-g section of the station to the nonzero-g ring. Gravity rings can be anywhere from 15m to 300m+ in radius, with smaller radii requiring shorter periods of rotation to achieve the same outward acceleration. Due to walking crew, moving cargo, or other redistributions of mass, the COM (Center Of Mass) of the gravity ring may shift away from its axis of rotation. This may cause the structure to wobble or shake, which is very dangerous. To prevent this, modern gravity rings are built with special plumbing systems on the outermost portion of the ring to automatically distribute liquids and align the center of mass with the axis of rotation.\n\n     Gravity rings can be used in place of [!2 Exercise modules], as the constant application of a gravity-like force is an adequate method of mitigating the effects of microgravity atrophy. Though, this is not a cost-effective alternative, as gravity rings can cost many magnitudes more than exercise modules.",

They are commonly found incorperated in ship designs made for extended stays in space.\n\n     Kitchenette modules come in various dimentions, and with various amenities. Commonly, kitchenette modules are made with a microwave oven, refridgerator, press-fryer, rehydration gun, micro-g wash basin, and [!1 micro-g dining table].\n\n     The microwave ovens found in these kitchenette are not unlike terrestrial microwaves. The notable difference is, instead of having a rotating platter, these microwaves have a rotating serrated skewer in the middle which cooks are intended to place food items over.\n\n     The refrigerators in these modules are very similar to terrestrial refrigerators, thouogh full of pockets, pouches, and boxes instead of shelves and trays.\n\n     A press-fryer is a cooking appliance used for frying and grilling food in microgravity. The appliance consists of a heated baseplate, four rods with fasteners, and a (sometimes also heated) top plate. The four rods are connected perpendicular to each corner of the baseplate. The top plate is aligned by the four rods and kept in place by the fasteners. When in use, press-fryers are usually draped with a mesh veil to keep most grease particles expelled by the food from floating freely in the cabin.\n\n     A rehydration gun is a simple tool. It is a small device consisting of a button, tube, and needle. When connected to a water outlet, it is stabbed into packs of dehydrated food to rehydrate it.\n\n     Micro-g wash basins are long, semi-enclosed spaces used for washing food or other things. The top of a wash basin holds a low-pressure water nozzle that emits water when objects are held near them. The bottom of the wash basin, which is a water receptacle, generates negative air pressure to keep water droplets from leaving the basin.",

However, through the white snow is dark rocks and fauna. It's atmosphere is bluish with a green tint to it. Some lakes of liquid water can be seen, as opposed to the frozen masses indistinguishable from land.\n\n     The ground is rugged and mountainous from a billion years without proper rain. Ridges of rock pierce through the ice and snow, only clues to the valleys formed by the heavy ice between them. The rocky ridges are the black outcrop of rocks seen from space, aligned with ancient mountains. There are a few areas where the crust still allows for magma to come up from the mantle. These volcanoes were called ‘the warmth' by ancient Galleats. The volcanoes only last for about 5 years before the plates they sat under would shift, fostering ecosystems around them seen nowhere else. Today, the surface is still white and icy. However, most ridges are inhabited by massive cities that extend out to the ice.\u0000css\n\n     Most plant life is hardy and dark to soak up as much sunlight as it can, having evolved to survive off minimal light, and tends to have abilities to store heat from the sun to keep their cell walls from disintegrating into ice crystals. The life, when DNA sequenced, shows that Gallean life was once more tropical and lush, supporting a leading theory that the planet was once closer to its sun Gavia, or the star itself has since become dimmer. It is accepted that the ancestors of the Galleat race were evolving during this time. As the sun drifted further and further, life had to adapt. Notably, many companies that offer cloud computing services are based on Gallea, commonly using Gallea's naturally frigid atmosphere for cheap cooling of components.",

Specifically, the craft was designed by the fledgling [!3 Eriian] government in the year 42. As the concept of interplanetary civilization developed in the Sol System, so did a need for interplanetary trade on Erii. The cargo volume of the [!3 Pelican], ~28m^3, had been a bottleneck in shipping resources from, and valuables to [!4 Itascus]. This lead to the design of the Walrus, which, by admission of its designer, being \"more or less just a long Pelican\". Due to the expected weight of added cargo, the Walrus's design has omitted hardware related to takeoff, atmospheric flight, or landing. While this reduces the craft's dry mass, it renders it incapable of landing on the surface of a planet. The Walrus is used primarily for transportation of cargo between [!5 Space Stations].\n\n     Due to its nomadic appeal, never needing (or being able to) make home on a planet, Walrus-model ships have spread across the [!6 GCP],  following the proverbial trade winds. Though, Walruses are still constructed foremost on the stations [!7 Excelsior] and [!8 Skypier]. \n\n     Since the Walrus was designed to go through lengthy periods of rushing through empty space with relatively large crews, it was designed with a [!9 Kitchenette Module].\u0000css\nComponent breakdown (Top to bottom):\n Component Name                         Manufacturer Mass   Diameter Height  \n [!10 Type A Docking Port]              (Various)    50kg     80cm    20cm    \n 3-Seat compact cockpit                 [!11 ISA]    3200kg   3.5m    2.8m   \n Lavatory                               [!12 IAC]    320kg    3.5m    60cm\n [!13 Kitchenette Module]               (Various)    1200kg   3.5m    2.2m\n Interior Air-Tight Divider Hatch       (Various)    120kg    (1m*2m rect.)\n Large Cargo Bay                        (Various)    1300kg   3.5m    8.2m\n ├Exterior Pressure Valve               (Various)    5kg      2cm     4cm\n ├Interior [!14 Cargo Rails]            (Various)    120kg    ~~~~    ~~~~\n └Exterior [!15 Type-C Docking Port]    (Various)    75kg     1.3m    20cm\n Inline Service Bay                     (Various)    200kg    3.5m    35cm\n ├10L Waste Storage Tank                (Various)    40kg     ~~~~    ~~~~\n ├Tri-Planar Reaction Wheels            [!16 IHMC]   160kg    ~~~~    ~~~~\n ├Life Support Cabinet                  ISA          40kg     ~~~~    ~~~~\n │├CO2 Scrubber                         ISA          70kg     ~~~~    ~~~~\n │├[!17 ArC] System (uses radiators)    (Various)    55kg     ~~~~    ~~~~\n │├[!18 MoTran] Life Support Controller [!19 Datec]  1kg      ~~~~    ~~~~\n │└Dehumidifyer                         (Various)    20kg     ~~~~    ~~~~\n └4x 50L Lqd.

When viewed from space, it appears as a varied iceball, with many salt oceans still existing on the surface without having frozen due to the salt lowering the freezing point. Icebergs the size of islands can be seen floating in the open ocean, while thin ice over the rest of the ocean surface leaves a distinct look from space. \n\n     Just inside the goldilocks zone of it's small star, the planet has cooled to near total freezing. It's massive salt deposits has allowed portions of it's seas from it's geologically ‘warm'  period to still show through the frost. In an astronomical timescale, its cooling was very recent, only happening within the last million years. Much of the surface is still quite rocky, harboring fewer glaciers than other [!2 Gallean] planets. The permafrost is thin across the planet's equatorial regions, due to the salt within the soil, lowering the freezing point.\n\n     Only relatively recently has the planet started its colonization, having begun in the year 46. It has the smallest population out of any other planet in the Gallean nation. The new terrain has proved strange and fascinating to Gallean colonists. With only 50 years of colonization thus far, the planet has only a few cities, with most of them being small settlements 10,000 residents at most. Though, unlike the typical cities,  the capital city of the planet, Zerania City, has 1.5 million permanent inhabitants. Zerania City holds a substantial amount of political control over the rest of the settlements, and therefore most of the planet.",

        "data": "css\n    The Skyrail is a type of transit system used as public transportation within large cities.  A Skyrail system is a fleet of autonomus and/or manually-driven railcars.  These railcars hang vertically from pairs of rails at least six meters off of the ground.  The rails these cars connect to span vast networks that cover entire inner cities.  The railcars can move up to 50 kilometers per hour (13 meters per second), and combined with their low risk of traffic delays, it makes them a prime choice for commuters desiring to get to somewhere in their city very quickly.\n\n    There are two common types of railcars in Skyrail systems, Personal Cars and Commuter Cars.\n    Personal Cars can be summoned at terminals by individuals, and commonly only have four seats.  Upon boarding a Personal Car, its passenger(s) interact with a computer onboard to select a Skyrail terminal in their city that they would like to be delivered to.  Personal Cars commonly directly cost money, or an intermediate currency made specifically for the system (ex: Skyrail tokens).  This is to offset the cost of maintaining the system.  Personal Cars, which are smaller, are connected to their rails above by one connector.\n    Commuter Cars are much larger boxcars, and can seat anywhere between sixteen to fourty people.  Commuter Cars usually follow schedules and routes, as opposed to going to a specified location on request.  This makes them more like city busses than a taxi service.  These cars, which are larger than others, are connected to their rails by (at least) two connectors.\n\n    Unlike [!1 trains], Skyrail cabs are able to easily start or stop on command as well as change rails for turning. This gives them the manuverability of a [!2 city bus] while avoiding the traffic of city streets.\u0000css\n    The physical rail networks usually hang over inner city roads and streets.  Because of this, Skyrail rail networks tend to match road networks within a city (though less-traveled roads are typically omitted).  Rails tend to hang over the exact middle of roads (or in the middle of lanes, if there are multiple rails over the same road).  The rails themselves are suspended by supports connected to the ground, or to the sides of structurally-sound buildings.  Skyrail terminals are elevated metal platforms resembling wide catwalks, or small plazas built into the sides of buildings.  Depending on the terminal's size, it may have benches for waiting passengers, restrooms, or other ammenities.  If a terminal is intended to be a node for Personal Cars, it will have a machine of some sort to accept payment (or Skyrail tokens) and summon a Skyrail cab.\n\n    Skyrail was first designed in the year 61 by the [!3 Trametro] company, which has maintained the system's design, applications, and implementations ever since.  The first Skyrail system with implemented in [!4 Liveston City] on [!5 planet Osirja], which quickly became a popular mode of transport.",

Rocketfields are places where spacecraft land and take off from, and are typically divided into two sections. Every rocketfield has a [!1 spaceport] that manages it.\n\n     The first section, referred to as \"the parking lot\", is paved and divided up into evenly-sized lots. These lots are commonly rectangular and are at least 200m^2 in area to allow for adequate clearance for landing ships. This section is only for ships that are able to control their landing, so that they can land in a specific lot. For some rocket fields with heavy traffic, specific lots may be premium. These premium lots are actually hydraulic pads, capable of lowering the craft into the ground. The craft is then covered from above by a large hatch (or sometimes a tarp) to keep it safe from a planet's weather.\n\n     The second section, referred to as \"the field\", is a much larger area, usually upwards of dozens of square kilometers. This section is commonly just open plains of soil or light fauna to act as a cheap cushioning for craft without landing gear (such as [!2 drop pods]).

The Amalgamate class is actually a very vague, loose class definition. Amalgamate-class ships are simply defined as being constructed out of components and chassis of multiple smaller ships. Most amalgamate-class ships are made out of just a pair of ships for the purposes of greater efficiency, interior volume, or other perks. Though, some of the larger, more successful amalgamate-class crafts are made of dozens to hundreds of smaller craft. Notably, amalgamate-class ships are popular with [!1 Disterrestrialist] communes, as the communes' generation ships, due to their large size requirement, are often constructed out of whatever is available.\n\n    While it's intuitive to think amalgamate-class ships would destroy themselves if they attempted an orbital maneuver, being made of many smaller (usually weakly) connected and asymmetric sections, many of these large craft are upgraded with specialized software modifications.  These software patches allow a ship to read its directional acceleration, rotational acceleration, and thrust of active engines to calculate the craft's center of mass in real time.  Since each section of the craft typically has its own engine cluster, the software is able to direct the craft's [!2 flight computer] to modulate each engine to put out the perfect amount of thrust to keep the ship balanced, correctly-oriented, and most importantly, intact.",

To fix a major design flaw of the previous model, the armor was made openable by the driver; by bending both arms and jutting the elbows back, the back panel would open, allowing the driver to exit the armor. The latch was also relocated from the upper back to the lower back.\n\n   These suits were the first variant of power armor to natively support a guidance computer in the form of a [!3 PA-MoTran] system. In order to make the computer guidance system more effective, every actuated joint in the armor was made controllable electronically, as opposed to being only controlled by the operator\n\n   Instead of the rounded appearance of the Mk.2, Mk.3 power armor is covered in ridges and similar structures that make the armor stronger and more resistant to blunt force.\n\n   The batteries on this version could last through anywhere between 50 to 70 hours of work.

This, along with the fact that a program running on one core cannot easily access the data of another, is why the parallel computer architecture is considered the most secure modern architecture.\u0000css\n    The number of cores a machine has determines the number of threads it can compute at once.  The mother processor is able to stop/start any core (meaning any program thread) at any time.  The mother processor also has complete control over the memory within each core, being able to change the program or data within each core during runtime with no restrictions.  The mother processor also determines what sections of Main Memory a core is allowed to access.\n\n    The memory in each core is (usually) limited to 64KiB and consists of [!2 Electric Memory], which is very fast. Main Memory, a special, larger section of memory separate from the cores, can be up to 4GiB (or more) in size and is controlled by the Mother Processor.  Though, despite this, Main Memory is much slower than core memory because it is usually made of [!3 Qi Memory].  A slave core attempting to run code directly from Main Memory will slow to a crawl due to the slower memory speeds.  This is why the amount of fast memory in a core determines what threads it can (effectively) process, as every program requires a certain amount of memory to be run.",

        "data": "css\n    Entropism is described as a belief system revolving around observing entropy. The word is derived from the word \"Entropy\", a measure of disorder and distribution of energy in a system, and the suffix \"-ism\", denoting a belief in or following of something. A common belief in this religion is that one is able to use entropy to gain insights about the world around them that they wouldn't be able to with normal means.\n\n    Entropism is popular belief in [!1 La'Foy], being followed by 68% of the population; and [!2 Ghillymede], being followed by 59% of the population.  It also has a small following in the nations [!3 Armalai] and the [!4 Solar Union], with less than 10% of the population identifying as Entropist.\n\n    The detail that classifies Entropism as a theistic religion is the belief that the universe itself is, or has a consciousness. This consciousness has free will, and with this free will, it exerts changes and forces in particles of matter. Individually, these changes to particles are too small to be measured with any physical tools. Together, the forces on each particle add up to move fluid matter, such as minutely effecting the flow of water, or creating a draft in the air. While these changes can be measured, the contributing forces are small enough that they can be dismissed as nothing more than the random movement of particles.\u0000css\n    Entropism, or belief systems resembling it, have been recorded to have started independently in many places throughout the galaxy. Though, its deepest developments root back to the planet [!4 La'Foy], where the major tenets of the religion were thought to have developed. Entropism, as we know it today, was properly developed in the -30s, solidifying the common beliefs of the religion.\n\n    Devoted Entropists gather weekly on a weekday of their choosing. They gather in buildings, or just specified areas, called Totem Houses. Entropists believe that, when trying to communicate with the universe, that greater numbers means greater power in the same manner that larger numbers of people can produce a louder voice. In these gatherings, the Entropists decide on something they desire the Universe to influence, something that requires a large change.  They then pray to the Universe together to try to convince it to enact their desired changes. After prayer, the gathering typically either leaves, or they stay for other social activities.\n\n    Some devoted followers of Entropism claim that their connection with the Universe's consciousness is so strong, that the Universe is able to directly manipulate the chemistry and synapses of their brain. This, allegedly, gives the person the ability to listen to, or even directly communicate with the Universe. These people are either referred to as \"Prophets\", or \"Lunatics\" based on their popularity.\n    \n    Though Entropism has received criticism from realist and secular groups for having no base in real physics, many of the core beliefs of the system are un-disprovable. For example, the claim that the Universe acts with forces too small to be measured is, by definition, un-disprovable, due to the fact that no real-world tools would be able to gather evidence against the claim.",

        "data": "css\n    While, like most religions, Entropism varies across the galaxy, there are a few notable common traits.\n\n    Transmission Pendulum:\n        A Transmission Pendulum it a tool used to communicate with the Universe. The common name for a Transmission Pendulum is a \"Hand Totem\", or they are just informally referred to as a \"Totem\". These pendulums are long fins arranged in an 'X' shape with two pairs of fins perpendicular to each other, or a 'Y' shape with three fins placed 120° apart. The 'X' arrangement is the more popular of the two in most Entropist communities. Though, notably, on [!1 Armalai] and [!2 Ganeimede], Entropists almost exclusively carry 'Y' shaped Transmission Pendulums. The fins, typically made of a light metal, are attached to a long chain, string, or other cable. While the lengths of the fins and cable can vary, the total length is usually around 30cm. A person uses a Transmission Pendulum by looping the string around their finger (or equivalent limb) and letting the pendulum hang at least 40cm away from their body. Once the pendulum has stopped swaying from the user's moving it into place, they then attempt to talk to the Universe's consciousness. They ask the Universe a question or make a request of it. Whether this communication is verbal or not is irrelevant; most Entropists believe that spoken language, thoughts, and the air disturbed by the pendulum are equally understandable to the Universe. While making their request, an Entropist will lightly sway the pendulum. This act is thought to embed the user's wishes into the disorder of the matter around them. Once they are done with this part of the prayer, they stop the motion of the pendulum. They then wait for a response based on the movement of the pendulum due to the currents of the air and/or the small, random movements of their bodies. The pendulum can give one of four responses: Swaying towards the user, swaying parallel to the user, swaying circularly, or remaining still.\u0000css\n    Totems and Totem Houses:\n        A Totem House is a place of religious gathering for Entropists. They are large buildings or outdoor structures that seat at least 10 people. The centerpiece of any Totem House is a massive transmission pendulum called a Totem. These Totems are many times larger than a handheld transmission pendulum, being upwards of two meters long. Totems are affixed by a rope or chain to a pulley on the ceiling. The room/space that the Totem hangs in is called the Glade. Using the rope and pulley, the congregation gather to pull and release the rope in order to cause the totem to swing. Glades are shaped like tall domes, sometimes even being described as \"egg-shaped\". Glades are very open spaces; very enclosed glades have just two large windows which allow the Totem to swing through them without striking the walls, while very open glades are constructed out of just a few arches to allow the Totem more freedom of movement. Glades are also open to allow airflow from outside to exert force on the Totem, so that the congregation may interpret communications from the Universe from its motion.\n        \n    Diffusion Watching:\n        Traditionally called \"Tear Shattering\", Diffusion Watching is the act of taking a clear fluid (clean water) and dripping one, or multiple drops of a dye or other visible fluid into it. By watching the seemingly random patterns in which the drop diffuses into the fluid, one could use it as a suitable, detectable type of entropy to interpret a response from the Universe after a prayer. In the past, Tear Shattering was seen by some as a method of congregated prayer. A congregation of Entropists would gather at the edge of a body of water before pouring cups, buckets, or barrels of dye into the water. This practice is rare in the modern era, as most districts on civilized planets treat the act as needless pollution, and most Entropists still believe a Totem is more appropriate for group prayer.",

        "data": "css\n    Local Time is timekeeping method based on the physical attributes of the body on which the Local Time is used. Initially, the units used within a local time system were completely different from those of another. As [!1 Unil] was spread and popularized across the known galaxy, the names for these units of time were standardized, even though they were still of different lengths. The common names for these units (in order of size) are as follows:\n    Year     - (Y) The orbital period of the local body\n    Season   - (S) A large fraction of a year, usually defined by changes in climate\n    Lunen    - (L) A fraction of a Season or Year, typically based on the orbital period of a natural satellite\n    Period   - (P) An uncommon subdivision of a Lunen\n    Sol      - (S) The rotational period of the local body, usually an even fraction of a Lunen\n    Meridian - (M) Almost exclusively one half of a Sol, though sometimes one third or fourth \n    Watch    - (W) Commonly a large fraction of a Sol\n    Tone     - (T) Commonly a small fraction of a Day or a large fraction of a Watch\n    Dash     - (d) Commonly a fraction of a Tone in any size\n    Point    - (p) The smallest unit that sees common use, a fraction of a Tone\n    Moment   - (m) A rare unit name used if the local time system in question uses a unit of time smaller than a Point\u0000css\n    To efficiently describe the local time system of a planet, many people write what is called a \"Time Table String\" to describe the units a local time system uses, as well as the proportions. Take the Time Table String \"1Y/2S/4L/24S/4W/6T/4d/36p\" for example. In it, it describes on year as being made up of two seasons, each season being made up of 4 Lunens, each Lunen being made up of 24 Sols, and so on. And using the period of the planet's rotation or orbit, one could do simple division or multiplication to solve for the exact measurements of each unit in the string. In the event that a planet's time system does not use a common name for a unit of time, the name for the unit is written out in full as opposed to using a common unit's abbreviation.\n\n    Some planets make use of a \"Floating Chronal Reference\". Having a Floating Chronal Reference means that, for an observer on the surface of a world, the current time within a day is not constant across the planet. Instead, it is based on the planet's sun's position within the sky (or more accurately, the longitude of the observer). Commonly on these planets, the local time of sol is determined by sunrise, local noon, or even sunset. For example, on [!2 planetary Itascus], the local Tone of Day is determined by time of local noon; 10-o-clock (Halfway through the sol) is defined as when the sun is in the middle of its arc across the sky.\u0000css\n    Planets with Floating Chronal Reference almost exclusively use a Time Zone system. In a Time Zone system, the planet is divided up longitudinally into equally-sized slices called Time Zones. Time Zones are used for large units of time that are less than a sol, such as Meridians, Watches, or Tones. The number of time zones on a world is determined by the number of units that the zones are divided by within a sol. For example, if the Timezones on a planet are based on Watches, and there are six watches in a local sol, the planet will have six Timezones. Time is the same everywhere within a Timezone, with each zone's time being determined based on its longitude. To represent Floating Chronal References and Timezones in a Time Table String, the string is prefixed with the following: the event that determines the time of day, sunrise ('R'), noon ('N'), or sunset ('S'); what time of day that this event determines (as well as the unit); and a character describing if the planet uses Timezones ('Z') (followed by the unit the timezones are measured in), or the time is absolute ('A') based purely on an observer's longitude. So, for example, planetary Itascus's string is \"N-10:00T ZT 1Y/12L/18D/20T/40d\", because the Floating Chronal Reference is based on local noon, and local noon is defined as 10-o-clock in Tones, and the planet makes use of Timezones that are divided by the number of Tones in a sol.",

        "data": "css\n    By the year -114, [!1 Gallea's] population had increased to over one billion. Around this time, two popular political positions developed, Hierarchism  and Late Industrialism. Hierarchism was strongly aligned with the ideology of capitalism as well as minor ideologies of small government. Hierarchism was backed by the leaderships of states and nations that descended from the tribes. Late Industrialism was more aligned with the standard ideals of socialism and a larger government. Late Industrialism was backed primarily by members that identified as Gallea's working class, who felt like their tribes and governments weren't meant just to help people from the outside, but financially in the inside as well. Though they still didn't believe in full government control. \n\n    By the year -53, the population had reached 1.2 billion and political tensions soon arose between the tribes and nations of the planet; the rising popularity of the planet's two main political parties instilled an “us versus them” mentality into many residents of the world. Within a decade, the scattered tribes and micronations banded together as they saw foreign ideologies as more and more of a threat to their own ways of life. The majority of the townships and tribes governed by a Republic system banded together into a federacy we call the SDD (Strategic Democratic Defense). The other townships and kingdoms, primarily with monarchical or autocratic rule, formed into two major factions. These factions were the RGU (Royal Gallean Union), which functioned less as an alliance and more a union into a single state ruled by Monarch democracy, and the GSA (Gallean Sovereigns Alliance), which was structured as a confederation. The SDD was strictly Late Industrialist by popular ideology, that being the trait that brought them together.-\u0000css\nThe GSA was fervently Hierarchist in direct opposition to the SDD, while the RGU was presenting itself as more centrist, while still leaning towards political Hierarchism. These names were translated from native Gallean into [!2 Unil].\n\n    Within a [!3 planetary year] of their formation, the GSA and SDD declared each other political enemies and general adversaries. The diplomatic tensions between GSA and SDD quickly boiled over, spurring a surprise invasion from the GSA into SDD territories with the intention of destroying the commoner governments. This marked the beginning of the Gallean World War, simply called the “War of Two Nations”. \n\n    The RGU kept itself neutral for three years while the war went on around them. That was, until the [!4 Skirmish of Shells]. This brought the RGU into the world war, changing the conflict's common name to “The Trio's War”. The 3-way war would end up killing 285 million Galleats, devastating cities across the globe. Throughout the seemingly endless bloodshed, the world's workforce was aligning more and more with the ideas of Industrialism, regardless of the proclaimed ideologies of their nations. The RGU was the first to convert to Late Industrialism, due to internal political pressure in -47. The RGU and SSD made an impromptu alliance in response to the change in political ties. The SSD shared a new technology with the RGU; a technology for higher definition, secure radio transmission. Working together, the RGU and SSD warred the GSA into submission by -46, ending the Gallean World War.",

The conflict between the two factions started on 4/8/-50, formally starting the skirmish. To keep their border from being invaded, the RGU military sent an infantry battalion to construct fortifications within their territory. The RGU infantry gathered in an abandoned mining village in the hills which they fortified and turned into a defensive position.\n\n     Both the GSA and SSD's scouts noticed the RGU's fortified hill position. Since neither party was aware of the RGU's presence, they both independently assumed it belonged to the other side, regardless of the position's distance from the main conflict. On the third [!2 galactic day] of the conflict, the hill base was bombarded by heavy artillery from both the GSA and the SDD. The leadership of the base declared it a direct attack, and communicated with the RGU military headquarters. The RGU military leaders began mobilizing more troops, and instructed the base to eliminate the enemy artillery.\u0000css\n     While the RGU's hill fort was being bombarded many times an hour, 1,500 of the RGU soldiers in the camp marched for three hours to go around the front lines of the main conflict and flank the GSA artillery, which was set up far from the trenches and hills. The surprise attack was a success, eliminating all three of the GSA's heavy artillery units as well as all the operators and the infantry escort. The surprise attack only wounded 32 RGU soldiers, and only killed 22. \n\n     The GSA infantry on the front lines, informed of the attack by radio before the position was destroyed, reasoned that they were routed by SSD attackers, and decided to retreat by a few kilometers. Since the small RGU force was returning to base after the surprise attack, they encountered many large companies of retreating GSA soldiers. This was the biggest cause of RGU casualties in the conflict, as they only returned to base with about 600 out of the 1,500 soldiers that left to strike the artillery.\n\n     In conclusion, this battle caused the GSA to lose a few kilometers of territory to the SSD as the front line advanced towards them. The RGU also formally entered the [!3 Gallean World War].",

This would cause the volcanoes to appear to move. They saw these volcanoes as newborn gods; as the god matured and battled with the gods of snow, it used its power to create earthquakes. The god would cool from expending its strength, explaining regular dormancy of the volcanoes.",

        "data": "css\n    As [!1 Ganeimede] appeared to be losing the [!2 Ganeimedic Rebelion], the Ganeimedic leadership was willing to try any idea to turn the tide of the crisis. They decided that the need to look for help from somewhere. And it couldn't be from [!3 Itascus] or [!4 Gallea]. They decided that their best course of action would be to get the public on their side. And so, they recorded an audio message, one that was meant for the world's ears. \n\n    The message they recorded was a plea for help. In proper [!5 Unil], the message was the following: “We, the people of Ganeimede, are but a small, lunar mining colony. Our only desire was the right to control the sale of the valuable materials that we mine ourselves, from our own planet. And for this, we are being invaded by foriegn powers. This is an affront to our autonomy, and even an affront to the very idea of a free cosmos. If this can be allowed to happen, what kind of example does this set for the future? If you can hear us, please, heed our plea; otherwise, we might not be heard for much longer.”\u0000css\n    The colony had no internet access, so it couldn't be uploaded. Broadcasting the message wouldn't reach beyond the invading Itacan army or the hemisphere of Gallea facing them. And it wasn't unreasonable to assume that attempting to send a ship with a copy of the message would only result in it being shot down. So, Ganeimedic leadership contacted their single warp-capable freighter in orbit. This freighter hadn't moved since the arrival of the Itascan occupation force. The freighter was contacted and given special instructions; the crew of two was, after receiving a copy of the message, to warp out of the [!6 Gavia] system and head to [!7 Deoria] and [!8 Bius Tu], sending copies of the message to news outlets on both worlds. After they were briefed, the crew were securely transmitted a copy. The copy was saved to a cassette tape. The Itascan occupation detected the craft warping away as they left with the message, but they were under the impression that the ship was still aligned with Gallea.\n\n    The messenger ship stopped near Bius Tu and promptly entered a stable orbit. They then docked with the [!9 Gazer] station. The crew of two entered the station to tell Ganeimede's side of the occupation. News of the Itascan occupation had already spread over the internet, but details were unclear. By chance, the leader of the Tuine nation, Bius Tu himself, was on Gazer for diplomatic reasons. The two messengers promptly requested an audience with the Tuine leader. After explaining who they were, they were allowed to briefly speak with Bius Tu. They played him their copy of the plea, and virtually begged for assistance. After a brief discussion, the Tuine leader told the messengers that their plea would be considered, and they were dismissed. The message was picked up by popular Tuine news organizations, and happened to gain more social traction among the Tuine populus compared to that of Deoria, being picked up by more mainstream media outlets on the planet.\u0000css\n    The freighter warped into Deoria's SOI and burned into a low, stable orbit. The craft then rendezvoused with [!10 The Nexus] and docked with it. After giving a copy of the message to anyone who would listen, they bartered for some supplies. They left within four hours of docking, cautious that Itascan warp-capable ships might have been looking for them. They warped away, heading for planet Bius Tu. The message, along with the story it related to, was quickly picked up by minor news outlets, but was largely dismissed by larger news corporations. The story gained some attention with the Deorian populous, and there was a small social push for government action to help the Ganeimedic miners. But this was challenged by a popular counter argument that it was not in national Deoria's best interest to sour relations with Gallea, or more importantly, Itascus, by assisting a small colony on a distant moon.\n\n    The crew of two, now that the message had been adequately delivered, decided that their directive had been fulfilled. Without instruction for what they should do after the mission, they considered what they should do next. They reasoned that returning to the Gavia system would mean the destruction of their craft upon detection, so they decided not to return home, at least not yet. Instead, they traded the last of the Helium-3 onboard their freighter for a sizable amount of food, water, and Hydrogen fuel. They then warped into local interplanetary space, and went radio silent.\n\n    Copies of the message spread from Deoria and Bius Tu across the fledgling internet. Notably, it eventually reached the Itascan and [!11 Ghillian] populations. The spread of the message to these locations is credited as being essential to the outcome of the Ganeimedic Rebellion.",

        "data": "css\n    As the [!1 Gallean government] started planning to colonize the planet [!2 Zerania], it became obvious that they would need many more warp-capable ships in order to reasonably bring enough resources to the planet to colonize it. Determined to stop relying on [!3 Itascus] for warp-drive materials, they began establishing mining sites on their moon, [!4 Ganeimede] in the year 42, collecting Helium-3 for use in making [!5 warp cores]. However, the project proved to be costly. Over time, the mining sites evolved into mining colonies, accidentally becoming a fully-colonized planet under Gallean control. \n\n    Under the weight of the new space logistics program to move Helium-3 and other resources, as well as the standard social welfare it was already paying to the miners, the program was having trouble financially. The wages of the miners became mismanaged, and eventually they were quietly lowered to ease the stress on the system. The lunar colonies expressed their discontent, but the government stated that there was nothing that could be done at the time. Many Ganeimedic miners expressed a desire to go on strike, but realized it would be logistical suicide; at that time, Ganeimede had no method of producing food or other essential products, so its citizens were reliant on their homeworld for their survival.\u0000css\n    Over the course of the next five years, the colony kept working to produce the Helium-3 that was being sent to Gallea for processing. All the while, they were improving their own infrastructure; they built indoor farms (as Ganeimede barely has an atmosphere to support plant life), water reclaimers, subsurface mines, metal foundries, oxygen generators, and every other essential machine for life on a planet. This also stimulated Ganeimede's internal economy. And, even though the Ganeimedic colonists were vocal about their discontent, their gripes were mostly silenced by the Gallean government back home, so new colonists were still arriving. In fact, the number of arriving colonists increased as new industry jobs were opening up. By the end of the five-year period, the population of the moon went from just under 2,000, to approximately 16,000. The planet kept its near unanimous, resentful attitude towards its homeworld, but since their collective voice was getting quieter over time and there was nothing they could really do, the attitude was ignored by the homeworld government.\n\n    In the year 47, the moon finally had all the systems in place that it needed to be self-sustaining. The mistreated workers could finally make a statement. They sent a formal message to the leaders of the mining program on Gallea, which was forwarded to Gallean government. The message stated that the colony desired to have control over the Helium-3 it mined, who they sold it to, and for what price. If their desire was not met, they would go on strike, and stop producing Helium-3 entirely. The Gallean government responded with offering to instead raise the workers' wages back to what was originally promised. The colony declined within a day, and added that if Gallea fails to make a choice soon, it would default to going on strike. The Gallean government was not willing to be rid of the cheap source of warp core material that Ganeimede presented.\u0000css\n    Neither Ganeimede or Gallea had any weapons of interplanetary bombardment, [!6 spacecraft] with weaponry, or even any [!7 combat spacesuits]. Seeing their foothold on the Aptha market starting to slip, the Gallean government quietly called an emergency [!8 GUN] summit on the matter. The Gallean leader, the Itascan [!9 Vice President], a [!10 Deorian] envoy, and a [!11 Tuine] envoy attended the summit. Gallea explained the problem on their hands, and offered 15% of the mineral rights of Ganeimede for 100 years to any party that would help bring the moon back under control. Deoria and Bius Tu expressed no interest, but the Itascan Vice President, after communicating with [!12 Itascus Himself], agreed to the terms. The Itascan government, at that time, had the second largest fleet of military spacecraft in the GUN. The Itascan military saw it as an easy mission, as Ganeimede's lack of any sort of military hardware was common knowledge. At the time, the GUN had a law stating that no two planetary nations could go to war with one another. And since Ganeimede had just under the population requirement to count as a colonized planet, ~16,100 out of the seemingly-arbitrary 16,384, it did not legally count as war. So, by starting hostilities towards Ganeimede, Itascus would not be breaking any international law.\n\n    Four days later, the [!13 I.T. Apocalypse] was in orbit of Ganeimede, acting as a Forward Operating Base for Itascus's occupation of the moon. The Itascan forces sent down eight [!14 Pelican-class ships], each containing three Itascan soldiers with small arms ([!15 pistols] and [!16 smgs]) and combat spacesuits. The Itascan army had no intention of opening fire on the unarmed colonists; they were ordered to prioritize causing no civilian casualties. But the Ganeimedics didn't know this, and they assumed the invaders to be dangerous.\u0000css\n    Each Itascan landing craft touched down at a large population center. They ordered each population center to allow them to land in the town's [!17 spaceport]. They had to request entry because, since Ganeimede has a miniscule atmosphere, every spaceport is inside an airtight environment, with each silo being sealed off with a hatch. Only two population centers obliged, though, meaning that the other six landing craft had to land on the Ganeimedic terrain near the towns, after which, they were still barred from entry on foot. The soldiers could not forcibly enter the towns, as breaching the structures would've undoubtedly caused civilian casualties.\n\n    Even though most towns on the surface were safe from harm from the Itascans (at the time), the Ganeimedics were aware of how poor their odds of coming out of this conflict victoriously, or even unscathed, were. And so, they recorded an audio message, and sent it off with their only warp-capable ship. This message was [!18 The Plea of Ganeimede], and caught the attention of the Tuine government, leading to them deciding to assist the lunar colony. The plea also gathered a large amount of attention from the citizens of [!19 Ghilly]. The Ghillians felt sympathetic towards the Gameimedics' plight, having started as a small moon colony themselves. But, while Ghilly did have a considerable population at the time, they didn't have the military resources to effectively help the colonists.\u0000css\n    Within two months, a large Tuine freighter ship stocked with weaponry, which couldn't legally be engaged by Itascan or Gallean combatants, warped to Ganeimede. The freighter entered a low orbit over the moon, starting short-range communications with Ganeimedic leadership. During which, the freighter refused all hails from the I.T. Apocalypse, though the ship was still broadcasting its [!20 callsign]. After confirming that the story told by the Ganeimedic messengers, the ones who were sent off with a copy of The Plea of Ganeimede, was accurate, they offered to help the colonists. The Tuine freighter stocked a landing craft with personal weaponry, and the lunar towns allowed the lander to park in each town's indoor rocket silo, one by one. With each landing, the local colonists were given dozens upon dozens of small arms, as well as combat spacesuits, to allow them to defend themselves.\n\n    The Itascan ground forces, which were still present, witnessed the Tuine lander visit each major Ganeimedic township, and reported it to the Apocalypse. The Apocalypse attempted, again, to hail to Tuine freighter, but the ship still refused to communicate. At this point, all eight major townships (excluding the two that allowed the Itascan occupation to enter) had weaponry, and they planned a coordinated attack. The colonists were also given a [!21 Quantum Comm] node, allowing for them to connect some devices to the galactic internet.\n\n    Under the cover of night, six Ganeimedic towns sent out small teams of colonists armed with [!22 ballistic weapons] and dawned in combat spacesuits. Each team stationed themselves at least 400 meters from an Itascan landing craft and waited for further instruction. Once all six teams were armed and in position, they fired in the direction of every exposed Itascan landing ship. The teams were instructed not to explicitly kill any of the invaders, only to make it known that they were now well-armed.\u0000css\n    The Itascan soldiers, stationed in their spacecraft, couldn't hear the sound of the automatic weaponry when stood outside in the vacuum, but from inside their landing craft, they could hear the bullets colliding with the hull. As the bullets were hitting the regolith around the ships, kicking up large clouds of dust, each of the six Itascan ships on the surface of Ganeimede simultaneously hailed the I.T. Apocalypse, declaring that they were being attacked by unidentified assailants, and were unable to return fire as they could not determine the direction from which the attacks were coming. Within minutes, the Itascan forces ordered all landing parties to return to orbit and rendezvous with the Apocalypse to regroup. Each of the six landing parties on the surface fled Ganeimede before re-docking to the Apocalypse. The two landing parties that were allowed entry into the towns' silos found themselves stuck, as both of the towns they were parked in locked down the silos as they gathered there, trapping them on Ganeimede.\n\n    The Apocalypse went radio silent as the occupation communicated with the Itascan leadership. Many groups of colonists had started celebrating as soon as the Itascan forces had left the surface, regardless of the fact that little had actually ended. Acting quickly, the Ganeimedic directors recorded another message. Though copies of the audio message itself have been lost, the terms were as follows: In exchange for the Itascan military stopping its occupation of Ganeimede, the six Itascan soldiers trapped in their rocket silos would be released. The Apocalypse would not accept any hail from any Ganeimedic or unrecognized craft. So instead, the colonists borrowed the transmitter from one of the captured Itascan landers. When the message was sent this time, it was acknowledged, but not responded to. And, for a short time, life continued as it was in the colony, even though the Apocalypse stayed in a high, polar orbit.\u0000css\n    The rebellion was attracting media coverage at this point. Media outlets had reporters stationed on and around the moon. Some were even allowed into the cabins and structures of the towns, interviewing the colonists on their thoughts about the encounter. Many of the colonists were surprised to hear the reporters referring to the event as a rebellion; the colony had not explicitly considered severing from the Gallean nation. Though, at that point, it seemed like it might have been inevitable, given how their homeworld had reacted to their resistance. Notably, media coverage of the event had reached the Itascan public. The new information was dense and concerning, in stark contrast to what little information was provided by state news.\n\n    A pair of Itascan [!23 Lucifer-Model] spacecraft warped into Ganeimedic space and entered a low orbit. Broadcasting their callsigns, they made their presence known to the colony. The Lucifer model of spacecraft was, and still is, designed for remote bombardment of a planet's surface. Onboard one of the Lucifers was the Itascan leader himself, [!24 Harry Lee], being present to oversee the endeavor. The ltascan president mass-broadcasted a message to the surface of the moon, relayed and amplified by the Apocalypse and the second Lucifer. “This is the Itascan president, Harry Lee. I am broadcasting to tell everyone in this planetary system that the Ganeimedic rebels have three sols(8.6 Galactic Days) to release the six Itascan prisoners of war, and return to production. Otherwise the largest structures on the planet will be bombarded from orbit.”\u0000css\n    Every population center on the moon received the message. Celebrations stopped. Journalists left the surface to watch from orbit. The Ganeimedic leadership was frantic, seeing their planet backed into a corner. Within hours, they contacted the Tuine military asking for their help, or at least their advice. A Tuine representative replied that they were unable to help; they weren't allowed to attack the Itascan fleet, and donating a frigate to the colonists would be expensive and likely only provoke a more violent response from the Itascan army. Instead, they informed the colonists that Ghillian leadership had been trying to contact them, securely. The colonists agreed to have their communications forwarded to Ghilly, opening talks with the fellow lunar world.\n\n    Through the media coverage of Ganeimede's predicament, the Ghillian people became sentimental to the colony's struggles. There was popular demand on Ghilly to help the colonists, and the government had been covertly formulating plans to assist the Ganeimedics, to help fix their perilous issue. Though, the Ghillians needed confirmation from the colony in order for them to help; their plan, the only plan they could theoretically work in the small amount of time allotted, required the Ganeimedic colony to commit to a full rebellion from Gallea. \n\n    The Ghillian proposition was transmitted to the other towns on the moon, and it was met with almost unanimous support. The colonists felt mistreated by their homeworld, even more so at that point than at the beginning of their strike; most of the colonists were elated when presented with a real opportunity to separate from the Gallean nation. The Ganeimedic leadership quickly sent their reply, accepting the Ghillians' help. And so, the Ganeimedic leadership was told the plan.\u0000css\n    Just seven days after the Itascan occupation broadcasted its warning message, five Ghillian ships appeared around Ganeimede, quickly landing as soon as they canceled their velocity. The five ships were [!25 Transit-class] spacecraft, equipped with the fastest warp drives, in total carrying over two-hundred Ghillian citizens. Again, all hails from the I.T. Apocalypse were refused. Despite the silence, the occupation forces did know the Ghillian plan, to a small extent; after the plan was discussed within the colony, details started to spread into the news as rumors. Immediately upon landing, the two-hundred Ghillian volunteers declared themselves citizens of Ganeimede, and the mayors of each of the towns formalized them as such. As soon as the transport ships landed on the moon (before the volunteers were actually given citizenship) the Ghillian and Ganeimedic governments declared that, since the colony now met the population requirement of 16,384, it legally counted as a populated world. Therefore, it could not legally be attacked under GUN law. As a show of good faith, the Ganeimedic colony released the six Itascan prisoners, allowing them to return to the Apocalypse unharmed.\u0000css\n    The galaxy got word of Ganeimede's new status, and they were largely supported by the general public. The rebellion was now a more popular topic than ever, being talked about across all the GUN's nations. Though the Itascan army was indifferent to the moon's declaration. The Itascan president, who was still in orbit of Ganeimede, was determined to secure the mineral rights and saw the Ganeimedic plot too ramshackle and impromptu to actually be considered legal. Though, the Itascan president was contacted by his social advisor back on their homeworld. The social advisor argued that, at this point, the general political backlash that would result from attacking the colony would far outweigh any boost to warp drive production would be worth. The president was reluctant to hear this from his advisor, even being described as vivid. Eventually, he relented, and ordered the Itascan ships to silently return to Itascus.\n\n    And so, without a single life lost, Ganeimede gained its independence, and Bius Tu and Ghilly and strong allies. Only a year later, at the next [!26 GUN Meeting], Ghilly and Ganeimede announced that they were forming together into a union, the nation now known as Ghillymede.",

These spacesuits can be augmented with light armor, heavy armor, energy armor, or any variation or combination of the three.\n\n   Creating a spacesuit designed to sustain damage (while keeping its operator alive) is a daunting challenge. There is an inherent fragility to equipment that is designed to maintain a thin, flexible barrier between a human and hard vacuum. Since a single breach in a standard spacesuit could lead to the death of the person inside within minutes, changes would need to be made if troops were to be expected to be fired at with light munitions and survive.\u0000css\n   There are two main types of Combat Spacesuits: Light Combat Spacesuits, and Heavy Combat Spacesuits.\n\n   Light Combat Spacesuits vary only slightly from standard spacesuits. Notably, Light Combat Spacesuits have every non-bending surface covered by an armor plate. Every joint on the suit (that can't be covered with a rigid plate without completely restricting movement) is protected by metal cuffs that stem from adjacent armor plates. These cuffs are placed at the elbows, shoulders, knees, and ankles. Since the waist does not have a metal cuff to protect the airtight inner spacesuit, they are instead by a veil or curtain of ballistic weave. Light Combat Spacesuits are dawned by military personnel who operate in the outermost cabins of combat [!2 spacecraft], whom are most likely to be struck by shrapnel from enemy fire. Though, those on inner cabins of military craft (or any cabin of non-military craft) are more often provided normal spacesuits, as they have less of a dexterity loss when compared to combat spacesuits.\n   \n   Heavy Combat Spacesuits are used in rare occasions where there is a need for infantry on a planet without an atmosphere. Heavy Combat Spacesuits more closely resemble [!3 power armor] than any kind of standard spacesuit. Since it's expected that these suits will be struck by direct fire, they are much, much bulkier than Light Combat Spacesuits. They typically consist of three layers: the inner spacesuit, which keeps the operator alive; an inner layer of ballistic weave wrapped over the spacesuit, designed to catch any shrapnel coming from the outer later; and an outer layer of thick armor plating. Heavy Combat Spacesuits can weigh up to 70 kilograms and greatly dampens a soldier's agility. Though, since the use of the armor is restricted to low-gravity worlds lacking an atmosphere",

This command takes you to the page you were on previously. For example, if you were on a page called \"page 1\" and followed a link that took you to a page called \"page 2\", you could then type the command \"back\" to return to the page you were on previously.

        "data": "css\n    In the beginning, Gallean life was a cold existence. Without fire, they huddled primitively in small, temporary, buildings made of packed snow and ice to shelter them from the cold. Few notable events happened as they traveled nomadically across Gallea's rocky surface. Though, in this time, their local folklore and [!1 religion] was greatly developed.\n\n    It wasn't until around the year -12,000 P.W. that they began to use dead plant matter as fuel for fires. This allowed for permanent settlements to be constructed. Within a matter of decades, many gatherings of ancient Galleats developed methods of agriculture, and subsequently animal husbandry, to sustain their sedentary lifestyles. The population quadrupled from 20,000 to 80,000 globally by the year -6,000. Annual growth had been slow and sluggish as surplus food was rare, leading to the development of closely-knit tribes in this 6,000-year timeframe. Some of these tribes would grow into small republics or kingdoms. Wars would occur and the population was stagnant until the year -821, when the legendary inventor, Xerlia Veras Gheriz, hailing from the Veraz tribe, studied the botany of Gallean plants and discovered much more efficient methods of producing heat energy, kickstarting a small industrial revolution across the planet.\u0000css\n    The revolution affected the planet's scientific progression, as well as its society. The new heating methods even allowed for food to be grown in more enclosed spaces, safe from the weather. This allowed farmers to breed out the hardy, unpalatable, weather-resistant traits in favor of breeding in more efficient, and more fruitful traits, making the food more edible. This led to a surplus of food, and population boomed, reaching 100 million globally by the year -500. This continued growth aided in letting ancient galleats specialize in their skills, as not every person had to commit to producing food. This led The new technology that used the friction heat tech soon powered and heated homes by -400.  The advancement of science continued, bringing new ideas on trade and lifestyle. \n\n    The population was reaching 1 billion by the year -114. And around this time the [!2 Gallean World War] was set into motion. Out of the war came a new global government that forsook the old tribal divisions from whence it came, and focused on the world's progress at large. It took six years, until the year -40, for the government to stabilize its control and functionally tax its citizens. The new management was met with little political resistance, as most citizens saw it as a new hope for a Late Industrialist utopia. The new global government was built around the ideas of equality, government-provided welfare, and a republican governmental system.\u0000css\n    With the globe underneath it, the new government began looking to the stars, and by -35 it had placed its first simple satellites in orbit. With what primitive mechanical calculations they had, they operated relatively efficiently. As the public's eyes were turned towards the stars as well, with promises of immense resources and prosperity, their field of space travel advanced very quickly (when compared to other homeworlds) bringing unparalleled prosperity to their star system. Each year, more and more resources were devoted to space exploration, establishing bases across the star system of [!3 Gavia] and landing a human on the neighboring planet [!4 Norlia] by the year -32. Since Norlia was so similar to Gallea, in its environment and temperature, it was discovered (based on samples) that some places on the surface of the planet would be able used to grow hardier Gallean plants with little modification. In the year -29, another mission was sent, the theory about growing plants was tested, and found to be true. Upon discovery that farmland was viable on the surface of another planet, the planetary government built a colony ship, promising vast swaths of land and prosperity for anyone willing to start a new life on Norlia. In the year -27, the first permanent colony was established on Norlia.\u0000css\n    As the Gallean race became a multiplanetary species, they needed to create infrastructure to keep multiple planets in communication. They developed radio systems using massive radio dishes, that can be turned and pointed at any target to communicate with them. Some curious Galleats pointed dishes towards nearby stars with unusually-high amounts of radio noise, hoping that they could decipher something from the static, and maybe even confirm other forms of life. The starbound dishes didn't yield much until in the year -8, when they received a clear, intentional message from 9 light years away. The message was sent from a local star, [!5 Simia]. The message came from the planet [!6 Deoria], and the Galleans immediately replied. This transmission was one of the first of [!7 The Great Contact]. As soon as the transmission from the Deorians was confirmed, it was taken by the government, and transmitted to every TV, radio, house, and business as breaking news. Gallea maintained contact with Deoria, and later [!8 Itascus], over the next decade, but without any sort of translation, the raw audio transmissions were nearly useless.\n\n    An Itascan envoy visited in the year 1, and gifted the gallean race the materials and instructions to build a [!9 warp drive], along with other technologies, as part of [!10 The Warp Endowment Campaign]. After training competent translators for the languages of other worlds, they met with the other planetary leaders in the year 10 and became a founding member of the GUN. To their surprise, they realized many other planets and forms of life were quite different from them. They searched endlessly for an icy planet in their observatories and with what few warp-capable scouts they had, not finding much besides icy moons of gas giants. They started to realize just how lucky they were to originate in a system with two habitable planets. Over the course of their search, they became more acquainted with galactic life and commerce.\u0000css\n    After discovering a potentially suitable planet 13 light years away in the year 41, they sent a warp scout and confirmed via landing crew that this planet might also be capable of supporting Gallean life, with a bit of terraforming, that is. This new planet was [!11 Zerania], and the Gallean government realized that they would need many more warp-capable ships in order to reasonably colonize the new world. The Government opted to start a program; seeing that their moon, Ganeimede, had useable amounts of Helium-3 on its surface, which is used in the production of warp cores. Zerania was successfully colonized in the year 47.\n\n    After [!12 The Ganeimedic Rebellion], Gallean command and government were thrown into chaos, feelings of inferiority and failure spread throughout the homeworld, as well as the other colonies. This anxiety marked the beginning of the Armament Era, lasting from 47 to 68. A deep fear was instilled in the Gallean people; in the wake of the loss of the moon of their own homeworld, it became a popular belief that the Gallean nation was gravely under equipped for extraterrestrial combat. This era was seen as one of technological progress. However, the era had its grim aspects; combat training was taught in schools, military technology was prioritized over many other programs, and the army of Gallea swelled with recruits. [!13 Personal weaponry] was legalized and licensed for use in self-defense, and in case a foreign power were to invade the planet. Their relationships noticeably soured with foreign powers, feeling betrayed by the other nations that acted against them in the rebellion of their moon. During the Armament Era, many Galleats feared that it was likely that a foreign power would see their nation as weak, and decide to invade. Although largely unjustified, these fears became deeply rooted in Galleat society. This era also saw the construction of planet-wide and orbital defenses around and on Gallean planets.\u0000css\n    The societal changes from Armament Era were challenged in the late 60s, as Galleats that were infants during the loss of their moon aged into maturity and became influential citizens. This was also due to no major conflicts occuring that could justify such a large military stockpile. Newer ideas of free trade and disarmament became popular throughout the colonies and homeworld. This movement was known as the “Rationalist Uprising”. Being mostly peaceful, they elected rationalist leaders into office, officially declaring the “irrational era” over in 68. The movement embraced the fields of technological research. The research was no longer for war, but for the advancement of all sentient species; developments that were previously created for military use were shared publicly, spreading to the rest of the GUN, developments such as advanced computation electronics used for ballistics. Gallean military enlistments plummeted as enlisting was seen as foolish, and the army deflated into very small numbers. This left only the most trained, and extremely professional fighting forces as the nation's military. The military itself was still supported by rationalists, but only for rare uses of professional soldiers as opposed to conscripts. The rationalist era is marked as spanning from the year 68 to the year 78.\n\n    The rationalist era ended slowly as the once strong, uniform movement splintered into smaller and more specific parties. However, Gallean society as a whole agreed it was in the best interest to restructure the government into a new socialist republic, where the Senate was the supreme body of governance, and the government provided all needed aid to its citizens. And its citizens, in turn, would provide all the needed work for their government. This continued on as parties continued to fracture, eventually leaving political alignment to be defined by a “Rationalist Spectrum”.\u0000css\n    This marked the beginning of the Stable Era, sometimes called the ‘Relaxed' period of Gallean history. Political movements became comparatively moderate. Even the professional army was content. The economy was adequately stabilized using a combination of Socialism and Capitalism to run its markets. This era spanned from the year 79 to the present, as Galleans have more-or-less maintained status quo and kept equity among its citizens. Though one aspect of Gallean culture has broken the stagnation, the computing industry. Many international tech companies have offices on Gallea as a result. The small, but modern, military polices the streets and trade routes with a combination of drones & surveillance algorithms. As of now, the nation is in its most peaceful period.",

The .380 hold-out pistol costs anywhere between $200-$300.\n\n This gun was invented in 32 P.W. by [!1 Tuine] Intelligence Forces with an intended use for their espionage and counterintelligence agencies, as well as for their special forces as a last resort weapon. It was considered standard issue, and was regulated by said Tuine intelligence forces. However, other agencies around the [!2 GCP] soon adopted similar variants with the same purpose. Now, they are still carried by some intelligence agencies and special forces units, but also by anyone who has the ability to purchase one as civil variants were created on planets such as [!3 Itascus] around the year 43 P.W..",

This weapon stands on the market at around $450-$500. Scopes made for the gun cost from $50 to $150.\n\n    The .360 revolver was created by [!2 Itascan] manufacturers to be marketed as a beefier, and stronger personal defense weapon. It was favored notably by gang members, security personnel, and those who expected to need more punch than a standard 9mm could give them. However the weapon became more sanctioned after a series of incidents involving AP rounds. ,The weapon is still widely popular in modern times, more so Itascus than anywhere else. However the AP rounds are no longer on many civilian markets and are closely regulated by most governments.",

It handles smoothly, but must be fired from a prone position.  If fired from the upright position, it could cause breakage of the shoulder or loss of balance due to the power of the rifle.

It was considered, in its early years of creation, to be one of the best anti-vehicle weapons due to its effective range and stopping power.  This weapon was extremely monitored by the Tuine government and was not allowed in civilian hands.  A few years after its creation, other military forces on major planets began to develop a similar breed of anti-material sniper rifles.  Today, most governments regulate these rifles for military use only. Though there are exceptions for planets like Itascus.

It is currently lacking a standard definition for weapon modifications]\n\n    There are two common types of connectors for weapon addons: Rail Mounts and Barrel Mounts\n\n    Rail Mounts come in three common sizes, Small (S), Medium (M), and Big (L).  The varying sizes are for different types of addons.  For example, smaller rails are used for smaller addons (like laser pointers or flashlights), while larger rails are for things like scopes, which weigh more.  Rail mounts are usually placed on the top of a weapon (for use with sights), but are occasionally placed on the bottom or side (for laser points or grips).\n    Many rail mounts are able to support multiple addon sizes with a single rail. (Ex: a weapon may have an \"ML\" rail, meaning it can connect to medium and large addons)  Some weapons have nonstandard railmounts, usually designed for nonstandard addons, and are not compatible with standard pieces.\n\n    Barrel Mounts are screw-on or latch-on connectors on the ends of the barrels of weapons.  Due to the large variety of barrel sizes, there are no standard measurements for barrel connectors.  Instead, barrel connectors (and addons that use them) are labeled using exact measurements (Ex: a silencer that screws onto the end of a 2-centimeter barrel would be labeled \"2cm Barrel Connector\").",

It is primarily used in closer range situation or used to quickly take out a threat.  It has a maximum effective range of 137.16 meters, which is less than the average pistol.\n\n    It costs about $350 dollars when bought from a distributor, and its price only drops to an average of $300 when bought on the civilian aftermarket.\n\n    This gun was originally manufactured on Bius Tu as an alternative to the more bulky 9mm pistol.  The engravings on the weapon were more for aesthetic purpose but, soon became a signature of the weapon's design, and as an allure to the Tuine public. Some planets have made similar versions of this weapon, however, they have low popularity as they are seen as just a weaker version of a 9mm pistol.  Today, it's not really used for anything besides self-defense.  It's design makes it slightly more concealable than other pistols despite it being generally considered weaker than other pistols out on the market.",

It is lighter and more streamlined than a normal shotgun due to a more utilitarian design.  This weapon, however, is built for use with special rubber pellets that are used in riot situations to “non-lethally” subdue a target.\n\nThis gun costs 800$ on the market.  The bullets of this weapon are intended to be non-lethal and are [!1 made of rubber].  However if shot point blank, or misused, this weapon can cause major injury or death.\n\nThis gun was first prototyped around 15 P.W. during the [!2 Itascan World War] as a “non-lethal” solution to quelling riots.  Unfortunately, as a prototype, it ended up having approximately a 50% mortality rate.  The [!3 Itascan Government] ended up making the weapon standard for swat and riot police in 17 p.w, but the weapon still had approximately 35% mortality rate.  Today, after the diffusion of the weapon type to other planets, the model has improved dramatically to only a 20% mortality rate. It is now considered as standard riot police gear on most planets.  Though, more commonly in non-police use, this weapon is now used with normal, non-rubber rounds.\n\nSpecial Information:\n    Weapon has a 4/20 chance to functionally convert rubber pellets into normal pellets.",

It has a medium length barrel and can fire unusually-powerful rounds.  In unskilled hands, the weapon can be harder to use due to its recoil, despite being outfitted with a gas-compressed recoil system to compensate. The gun itself handles rather smoothly but requires upkeep far more often than most pistols. This weapon is bulkier than other pistols so it is far less easy to conceal or use in a stealthy fashion. \n\n    This gun costs about $700-$850 on the common market.  The gold variant costs $1500 to $2000.  Sale of the gold variant is frowned upon, as it was only intended for use by the [!1 presidents of Itascus].\n\n    This gun was invented under orders of the Itascan president [!2 Kyle Stanley], who needed a pistol to “really make a statement”.  For the time, this weapon was considered a marvel of engineering by the Itascans.  They were able to create modifications to the gas-compressed recoil system invented by the Tuines.  It came into common use by select military units during the [!3 Itascan World War], and soon was opened to the consumer market.  This pistol has become a symbol of Itascus, as each president since Kyle Stanley has carried one with a golden chassis, and has thus earned the rather comical nickname “Itascan Peacemaker”. Today, the gun is still used by many planets, primarily in [!4 Itascus].  While the gas-compressed recoil system is harder to maintain, many people favor this weapon for its superior stopping power as a pistol.",

It works by halting the user's menstrual cycle, rendering conception impossible in all currently-known human species, and most known animal species as well.  Ferilin dissolves very easily in water, making fluids an effective medium of application.\n\n    In ancient times, Ferilin was derived from certain plants on [!1 La'Foy] which were thought to be [!2 magical] in the nature of their effects.  While, in reality, the useful effects of the plants were actually achieved through chemical means.  In the late 20s, Ferilin was discovered to be derivable from simple chemical processes, making it producible on the large scale.  This ease of production is credited as the reason why Ferilin is cheap enough (to produce) that it was able to be deployed large-scale on [!3 Armalai].\u0000css\n    Ferilin can be potentially problematic when consumed in large quantities.  When overdosing on Ferilin, a user's physical body will cease to grow.  This does not mean that the user will \"stay young forever\", or much less become immortal; the user will still age and expire naturally.  An overdose simply means that the user will cease to develop, stunting their growth.  Save for drowning in it, there is currently no known way to fatally overdose on Ferilin.",

Theracaine also comes in cream form for non-wound topical applications, and in pills so it can act as a general painkiller.  In higher doses, Theracaine will act as a whole-body sedative.  Theracaine, across all [!2 GCP] nations, is either perscription only, emergencies only, or an outright illegal substance.\n\n    Theracaine is a common compound found in plants of every known [!3 vivotype], and therefore is a very common, and popular, endorphiat/depressant substance.  Like most endorphiats, Theracaine can be quickly removed from a user's system by dosing them with a medicine containing [!4 Terinol].  Terinol can be used to keep a user from dying from an overdose.\u0000css\n    In the case of a nonfatal overdose, a user may feel dizzy and/or overly-tired, exhibit slow speech with shallow breathing, and have an unstable gait.  If the user is of a species that has visible pupils (pupils visually discernable from the user's corneas), they will likely be made to appear very small as the corneas relax.  If someone recieves a fatal overdose of Theracaine, they will stop standing and may even fall unconscious.  At this point, the user will become unresponsive.  After this, the user's breaths will become progressively more shallow until breathing stops entirely.  The recipient of the fatal dose will expire from suffocation within minutes after they have succumb to respiratory depression.",

They were invented by a [!1 Tuine] military contractor in the year 32 as a tool to immediatly stop bleeding from combat-related wounds.  Packer Shots contain a moderate dose of [!2 Theracaine] to numb the typically-extreme pain of wounds gained through combat.  Specifically, Packer Shots are used to temporarily close bullet wounds.\u0000css\n    A standard packer shot consists of a seven-centimeter-long, one-centimeter-wide metal or hard plastic cylinder.  On the side of the cylinder is a tall button along the edge.  Inside the cylinder is a pellet of condensed fibers connected to a spring-loaded piston.  When the button is pressed, the spring is released, ejecting the fiber pellet into whatever is immediately in front of the opening on the cylinder.  Within the pellet is two chemicals: The first is a 150mg dose of Theracaine to numb the wound, and the second is reactive foam chemical.  This foam chemical, when making contact with a water-containing substance (such as blood), quickly expands and hardens.  The use of this foam is intended to immediately stop bleeding.  The pellet itself, when not expanded, is a cylinder which is almost one centimeter in diameter and three centimeters in height.  The pellet is specifically compacted to expand in the plane perpendicular to the axis through which it was inserted.  Packer shots come with a small elastic cap over the opening to keep the active chemicals from coming into contact with water when not in use.  This cap is meant to be removed before the packer pellet is applied.\n    \n    A Packer Shot is only a temporary solution to an injury.  If the wound was caused by a [!3 Ballistic weapon], a packer shot will not remove the bullet, it will simply be layered over it.  Wounds should not be allowed to heal around a Packer Shot Pellet, as this would create a permanent opening in the flesh.  After application, the recipient of a packer shot should see a physician at their earliest convenience to have the bullet removed and the wound dressed.",

A Qi entity only exists as long as the charged Qi particles within it remain contained and remain charged. \n    \n    Qi Entites have a homogenity property, meaning that all charged Qi particles within have the same spin, allignment, and \"Qi heat\".  The \"Qi heat\" describes the speed at which the entity's Qi particles move within the entity.  All three of these properties determine the entity's \"function\".  The entity's function determines how the entity acts, and some functions can be very useful.\n\n    On top of having different functions, Qi Entities can have physical protrusions called \"links\".  These Links can connect to nearby Qi Entities, binding them, and allowing them to influence one another.  Collections of Qi Entites bound together are called Qi Structures.\n    \n    Linking Qi Entities to create structures, combined with setting Qi Entity functions, results in a useful craft called Qi Invocation/Qi Programming, though some older circles still refer to this as \"spellcasting\"/\"enchanting\" or simply \"magic\".\u0000css\n    A Qi Entity, given time, will naturally dissipate and cease to exist as the charged, energy-baring particles within it either escape or naturally discharge.  Though, Qi Entities manifesting in solids last thousands of times longer than those mainifesting in fluids (such as water or air).  This is thought to be because a Qi Entity in a fluid, which naturally attempts to maintain a spherical shape, is constantly being subjected to small currents which whisk off a small amount of qi-containing material.  For example, if a Qi Entity was created and manifested in air, it would be pushed around the environment by air currents.  But this is not what causes the energy loss; the loss is caused by fluid currents within the entity pushing Qi-manifested material out of the sphere (therefore discharging the particles and losing the energy) and pulling non-Qi-containing material into the entity's sphere.  Eventually, this causes a total loss of energy in the entity, causing it to dissolve.  Entities manifesting in solids do not have this problem (more accurately, the extent to which they have this problem is negligable).  Instead, Qi Entities in solids dissipate through the natural decay of the charged Qi particles within them (into uncharged Qi particles).\n    \n    Since Qi entities are a component of all known human species' anatomies, most people can produce a programmable Qi Entity from their own body.  These Qi Entities can be reprogrammed to perform a function different than the one it performed while in their body.  They can then be used to make complex Qi Structures.  Though, the act of pulling a Qi Entity out of one's own body is a difficult skill to learn, as it's not something humans are supposed to naturally do.  Despite this, some people spend years of their lives studying and training themselves to be able to extract Qi Entities from thier bodies so that they can perform Qi Invocation without the assistance of a tool.",

Though this smaller size comes with the downside that Qi RAM can only be accessed at a frequency of up to about 130 Kilohurtz.  Physically, Qi RAM works by changing the polarity of the crystal microstructures making up each bit, which can be interpreted as \"ones\" and \"zeroes\".  When in use, Qi RAM takes less energy than Electric RAM to operate.  When not in use, a module of Qi RAM can be given a small amount of energy to keep the cell of memory non-volatile (meaning that it will not succumb to data rot).   \n    \n    Qi ROM chips are much smaller than Qi ROMS.  For example, an electric ROM chip holding 32 Kibibytes can fit in a crystal wafer about the size of a human thumbnail.  The read speed of Qi ROMs can be up to 200 Kilohurtz.\n    \n    Due to Qi Memory's smaller size and lower cost but slower speed, it is best used in a computer's [!2 main memory] or in small devices that don't require fast memory.",

Because of this, Runes will naturally lose a small amount of their energy over time.  Though, the amount of time it would take for a Rune to lose enough energy for its enchantment to dissipate is (usually) over one hundred years.

Due to the loss of nearly 45% of the Counterintelligence and Espionage Field Agents based on [!4 Itascus] during the war, the departments were in serious need of new agents to fill the empty positions.  So Alexi put in place the Early Bird Espionage Program. \n    \n    The program focused on children from around the ages of 6-10 who showed heightened physical and/or intellectual prowess in [!5 Primary School] and train them to be Counterintelligence or Espionage Field Agents.  These children would be moved into special schooling environment and taught, from then on, in the arts of coercion and espionage.  The Program was able to produce hyper-specialized, excellently-trained Field Agents of young adult age within 10-12 years.  This also meant that, since they were so young, they could serve for their assorted agencies for longer than individuals who entered as adults.  After the war, this program produced many Field agents and Spies that were then tasked with gathering intel and information.  This Program proved to be advantageous for the national departments, so it continued up until the year 108 P.W. when the GCP was reformed.",

This specific anxiety disorder was originally thought to be a subclassification of Agoraphobia —— an anxiety disorder in which people fear and avoid places or situations that might cause them to feel like they're helpless or unable to escape.  More recently, the condition has been found to be at least partially psychosomatic.  People with SpAD often experience panic attacks where they begin to lose attachment to reality, believing they are about to die to the endless vacuum of space. \n\n    This type of anxiety disorder is usually triggered by the use/prospective use of space craft and interplanetary travel, however, as most citizens of the [!2 GCP] don't utilize space travel there are significantly fewer incidences of SpAD than there would be otherwise. In a recent survey conducted by the IPC, less than 1% of people with SpAD continue to make regular interplanetary trips after initial diagnosis. The most common medicine prescribed to treat SpAD is [!3 Visage], less often referred to by its active ingredient, [!4 Hyporezide].\u0000css\n    People with SpAD often have at least a few of the following symptoms:\n\n        - Crippling sense of impending doom or danger\n        - Shortness of breath/trouble breathing\n        - Nausea\n        - Chest pain\n        - Chronic migraines\n        - Vertigo\n        - Passing out\n        - Tingling sensation in extremities\n        - Uncontrollable feelings of spinning or floating, even if standing still or laying down\n        - Detachment from reality",

        "data": "css\n    Cascading Branch Networking Protocol is a Machine Networking Protocol used throughout the [!1 GCP].  It is used to transfer data between connected computers, and can even be used between computers on different planets.\n    \n    A CBNP network is a layered network.  Every connected machine/router in the network is connected to a single machine/router.  The router the device connects to is considered one layer \"above\" the device, and all devices that connect thought -it- are considered a layer \"below\".  Every device has a single 8-bit routing number (ranging from 1 to 254) assigned to it by the router above it or manually.  No two devices connected to the same router on the layer above can have the same routing address, as this would cause problems.\n    When data is sent over a CBNP network, it first travels \"up\" the network by a certain number of layers.  This is called the \"ascent\" stage.  After that the data packet enters the \"decent\" stage.  Within the address is a list of the routing numbers of every router on the way down to the recipient device, ending with the recipient's routing number followed by zero (since routing numbers can't be zero, this defines the end of the address).\n    CBNP has two addressing modes: Relative and Absolute.  In Relative Addressing, the \"ascent\" stage lasts for a specified number of layers before it decends.  In Absolute Addressing, the packet ascends all the way to the router at the highest layer on the network, called the \"head router\", before it decends.  For CBNP addresses using Absolute Addressing, the number of layers the packet needs to ascend before decending is set to 255.\u0000css\n    \n    The following is a diagram of a CBNP network:\n    \n                    X[N/A]\n                    |\n        +-----------+-+--------------+\n        |             |              |\n        A[3A]         B[42]          C[8F]\n        |                            |\n  +-----+-----+                +-----+-----+\n  |           |                |     |     |\n  D[05]       E[C8]            F[FD] G[62] H[B9]\n              |                      |\n        +-----+-----+                |\n        |     |     |                |\n        I[01] J[02] K[03]            L[01]\n        \n    In this diagram, each letter (A through L) is a device/router on the network.  The 'X' at the top is the head router.  Next to each letter is the machines routing number.  As an example, if machine 'J' in the diagram wants to send something to machine 'G' (using Absolute Addressing), it would use the address \"FF-8F-B9-00\".  The \"FF\" is 255 in decimal, and tells the routers above it to carry the packet all the way up to the head router ('X').  After that, the head router reads the second number, \"8F\", and sends it to the router below it with the routing number of 8F (which is machine 'C').  Then, machine 'C' reads the next number, 'B9', and sends it to the machine under it with the routing number 'B9', which is machine 'H'.  Machine 'H' gets the packet and reads the next number as '00', and then machine 'H' knows that the packet is intended for it, and accepts it.\n    For a real-world example, let's imagine that devices 'F' and 'J' are a [!2 telephones].  The user of telephone 'F' wishes to call telephone 'E', so they dial \"FF-3A-C8-02-00\".  The first number will bring the packet up to the Head Router 'X', the second down to the router 'A', the third to router 'E', and the final number '00' terminates the decent.\u0000css\n    Cascading Branch Networking Protocol uses collections of bytes (that can be transferred over a network) called packets.  Packets can vary greatly in size, being anywhere from under 100 bytes to 64 Kibibytes in total.  A CBNP packet consists of Five sections, which are the following (in order):\n        \n        Header Section\n        Recipient Address Section\n        Data Section\n        Return Address Section\n\n    Header Section:\n        The first two bytes of the header section are the values \"55\" and \"AA\" for a sort of integrity check\n        The third byte is the length (in bytes) of the address, including the terminator.\n        The fourth and fifth bytes are a 16-bit number describing the \"channel\", which is used to identify what type of traffic the packet is for (ex: phone call, web browsing, file transfer).\n        The sixth and seventh bytes are a 16-bit number describing the size of the Data Section (in bytes)\n        The ninth byte is a number representing which routing number in the address is the next routing number to use as the packet 'decends'.  This number is called the \"Address Offset Byte\" (If this number is zero, it means the packet is in the 'ascent' stage.  If the number is nonzero, it means the packet is in the 'decent' stage.)\n    \n    The Recipient Address Section contains the recipient's CBNP address, with each number being one byte\n        If the packet is in the 'accent' stage, the first byte of the recipient's address (the counter for how many layers to 'ascend') is decremented.  If this decrement results in the number being zero (meaning the packet has reached the end of its 'ascent'), then the Address Offset Byte is set to \"1\", marking the start of the 'decent' stage.  If the router handling the packet is a Head Router, it will unconditionally begin the 'decent' stage.\u0000css\n    The Data Section is the data contained within the packet meant to be delivered to the recipient\n    \n    The Return Address Section contains the return address and is constructed during transit\n        The first byte is the length of the return address (in bytes)\n        The rest of the Return Address Section is the return address\n        \n        During the 'ascent' stage, each router that the packet travels through adds its router number to the end of the return address.  It also increments the byte describing the size of the return address.\n        Once the packet ends the 'ascent' stage, the router handling it appends the return address with '00', terminating it.\n        For every layer the packet passes through in the 'decent' stage, the router it's passing through increments the byte representing the number of layers the return address should 'ascend'.\u0000css\n    As an example, lets say we wanted to send the numbers zero through seven in a packet from machine 'H' in the previous diagram (absolute address: \"FF-8F-B9-00\") to machine 'K' (absolute address: \"FF-3A-C8-03-00\").  For the purpose of this example, let's say the Channel being used is \"ABCD\".\n    \n    When the packet is first sent, the bytes making it up will look like the following:\n    \n55 AA 04 AB CD 00 08 00 FF 3A C8 03 00\n└────────Header───────┘ └───Address──┘\n\n00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00\n└─────────Data────────┘ └┴─Return Address\n\n    By the time the packet reaches the recipient, it will be the following:\n    \n55 AA 04 AB CD 00 08 04 FD 3A C8 03 00\n└────────Header───────┘ └───Address──┘\n\n00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 04 03 8F B9 00\n└─────────Data────────┘ └─Ret.

Because of the low content of Carbon used in the Steel (%1), the alloy is more ductile as opposed to brittle, and will not become a dangerous projectile itself when impacted.\n\n    Due to the high density of the Uranium in the alloy, the metal can easily absorb the kinetic energy of a bullet ( according to the fundamental principles of dynamics: The sum of all external forces applied to a system divided by its mass gives its instantaneous acceleration, so a greater mass leads to lower acceleration).\n\n    All of these factors make Wiron a very useful alloy for protection of military assets.  But, Wiron has a considerable downside; it remains expensive to manufacture and ship, and is too heavy for some applications (for example, if Wiron used to plate a ship, it will greatly decrease the craft's fuel efficiency).",

One of the main draws of choosing Starliner over a public transportation company is that Starliner, for a price, can bring a warp ferry to any requested planet.\n\n    Being based on Bius Tu, their headquarters of the company is at the center of their area of operations, as Bius Tu is at a junction between the Homeworld circuit and the Transport circuit.  Because of this, Bius Tu is the planet where most of the company's Warp Ferries are parked around.  Starliner Ships are temporarily removed from operation for maintenance once every four [!8 galactic years], or once the ship is in need of repair.\n\n    Starliner is currently in a partnership with the [!9 Lypho Company].  In this partnership which began in the year 58, Lypho exclusively provides all of the food products provided for Starliner flights, and Starliner recieves an unconditional 20% discount on Lypho products.",

Created in the year -22, before the unification of Itascus, the ISA had been one of the most productive entities in astronautical research of all time.  The ISA was the first entity to put an [!1 Itascan] in orbit and the first to send probes out of the [!2 Skoth] system.\n\n    In 0 P.W., the ISA's research and development team made one of the most important discoveries of all time: The [!3 Warp drive], opening the stars to the Itascan people, and subsequently the delivering this ability to the rest of the galaxy.\n    \n    The ISA has been an important party in colonization within the [!4 Sol] system.  In the year -23, the agency landed the first permanent colonists on the surface of [!5 Erii], and supported the colony until it became self-sufficient.  From the years 1 to 9, the ISA turned its efforts towards terraforming [!6 Urra], and in the year 9, they planted the planet's first permanent colonists.  Finally, the ISA sent colonists to the planet [!7 Uudil].  But, the Uudilian colony was abandoned once all eight of the original colonists died from complications\n\n    The ISA, up until 23 P.W., was the cutting edge of space travel in the Itascan nation.  But, since then, the organization has taken a backseat to private space-industry organizations.  Now, the prime functions of the ISA are constructing the [!8 Itascan Fleet] and maintaining the [!9 Excelsior] space station.",

The station is made for two tasks: constructing ships and harboring the higher management the Exospace company.  The station's body is easily recognizable by its red & black paint scheme.  The traffic of the space station can be divided into three categories, constructed ships leaving the station, transfer of personnel, and supply shipments.\n\n    The station itself has four distinct sections: the Core, the Docking Bay, the Shipyard, and the Rings. \n    \"The Rings\" is a collection of four [!2 Gravity Rings] stacked on each others' axes.  Each ring is 100 meters in diameter and 9 meters in width.  Each ring in the array rotates opposite of its neighbor(s) for stability.  The rings hold living spaces, recreational spaces, and office spaces.  Each ring is tuned to produce 1.04 Gs.\u0000css\n    The Docking Bay is 32-meter long cylinder at 4-meters in diameter and is connected at either end to the Rings and the Core.  It has eight [!3 Type-A Docking Ports] for transport ships and four [!4 Type-C Docking Ports] for cargo.   \n    The Core is the the center hub of the space station, and contains the stations nuclear generator, life support systems, and storage. \n    The last section of the station is the Shipyard.  The Shipyard is a large, cylindrical, scaffold-esque tube which is connected to The Core at one end and open at the other.  The scaffold is 330 meters long and 60 meters in diameter.  The shipyard is made up of two sections: the manufacturing section and the assembly section.  The manufacturing section is used to physically construct spaceship parts, and the assembly section is where those parts are assembled into spacecraft.  Notably, this structure has four [!5 manipulator arms] used in ship construction.\n    In total, the station is 472 meters long and has a diameter of 60 meters (diameter discounting the gravity rings).  The Molokai Station is capable of building ships up to 200 meters long.\n    \n    Life on the station is dictated by the quality standards of Exospace, the living standards are high but, but work standards set by the organization are strict, and have been reported to be unusually stressful to both higher managers and construction workers.",

Tapes are able to be made at higher data densities, but higher densities of tape are found to be more prone to corruption or simple data rot.  Individual Ferrotapes have a read/write speed of ~4.2 Kibibytes per second.\n\n    The cases of Ferrotapes are most commonly metal, but are ocassionally made of other materials such as enamel or plastics.  Inside of this case is two (or more) spools holding the lengths of magnetic tape on which the tape's data is stored.\n\n   Accessing and manipulating the data is done using a piece of hardware called a Tape Reader, Tape Drive, or Ferrotape Drive.  In this drive is a small piece of hardware called a reader/writer head.  This head rests against part of the tape's case at which the tape is exposed.  The reader head can then read the data on that position of the tape, or write data to the tape in the form of magnetism, effectively reading or writing with the disk.  The Tape Drive selects which point on the tape its reading by rotating the tape's spools, which moves the length of tape.\n\n    There are many common dimensions for tape drives across the [!1 GCP].  The following are a few common dimensions:\n        10x6x1 cm - 4KiB to 64KiB\n        16x10x2 cm - 8KiB to 256KiB\n        5x4x2 cm - 2KiB to 32KiB\n\n    Tapes 5x4x2 cm or smaller are considered \"Microtapes\".",

        "data": "css\n    Tapedecks are arrays of standard Ferrotapes meant for large amounts of storage.  Within a Tapedeck is multiple Ferrotape readers, each with their own Ferrotape.  The Tapedeck has a controller that manages every reader head within the Tapedeck, treating them as one large, singular data volume.  The number of Ferrotapes in a Tapedeck is usually a power of two (Ex: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32).\n\n    Tapedecks are able to attain read/write speeds several times that of an individual Ferrotape.  This is because Tapedecks spread their data across all of the tapes within them.  The Tapedeck makes use of this because it means it will take a fraction of the time to read/write every individual byte.  For example, if a Tapedeck has 4 Ferrotapes in its array, it will access data 4 times faster (16.8KiB/s) faster than an individual tape (4.2KiB/s).  Usually, all the tapes within a Tapedeck need to be the same storage size.\n\n    There are two configurations of Tapedeck: Swappable and Non-Swappable.  Non-Swappable Tapedecks have cases that are not intended to be opened, and are not made to be maintained.  Swappable Tapedecks are able to be opened, and have the individual tapes within them replaced.  Though, before removing a tape from the array, it's suggested that a user \"reshuffles\" the data on the Tapedeck to render the soon-to-be-removed tape unused.  The user can then safely remove the tape from the deck.  If the user then replaces the tape with another, the user should then \"reshuffle\" the data in the deck again to make use of the new tape.\n\n    Some Tapedecks are made with a \"multidrive\" setting, where the Tapedeck can dynamically make multiple logical data volumes out of specific tapes, up to the number of tapes in the deck.  This is also achievable by special software.",

Known since the dawn of the [!2 Itascan race], the moon has always had a important place in Itascan mythology, being associated with war and power.\n\n    The red surface is mainly composed of mountains, valleys, and gigantic continental plateaus.  Surprisingly, Ice is found on the highest mountain caps of the moon, despite with the relative warmth of the planet.\n\n    Towns and places established after the year 62 have been constructed and placed underground.  This is for two reasons: allowing for the exposed land to be used for farmland, and making Urran homes and buildings more difficult to invade.  The population in these newer areas, which make up almost a third of the developed areas on the planet, have their houses underground.  There are even entire small towns on Urra constructed completely below ground, with only a handful of (fortified) entrances. \n\n    The planet is one of the main producers of food across the GCP thanks to a naturally fertile soil (for most plants in the [!3 Itaus] vivotype) and resting at a perfect temperature for agriculture.  The small axial tilt of the planet is also advantageous, guaranteeing a constant temperature across the year.  Planetary Urra has fueled interplanetary commerce through their export of valuable food and import of nitrates (organic waste) to supplement their fertilizer supply.\u0000css\n    Even though Urra's industrial sector is small, the Urran industrial complex's has been skyrocketing since the completion of [!4 the planet's mass relay], the cheaper access to space, and the abundance of valuable resources attracting international companies.\n\n    Urra's [!5 Time Table String] is heavily based off that of [!6 Itascus], and is \"N-20:00T ZT 1Y/12L/12D/40T/40d\".

Habiuetine was branded as Cisvatic in the year 70, after lengthy medical trials beginning in 65 which concluded that Habiuetine was a safe treatment for many long-term stress disorders.  However, after the regulation of Habiuetine as Cisvatic, the potency of branded Habiuetine was decreased dramatically and black market dealers began to profit on the success of their new highly addictive street drug [!4 Spirit Honey].\n\n    Habiuetine's raw materials can be found on most planets naturally, and is manufactured using chemical synthesis.  Habiuetine should not be combined with other depressants.\u0000css\n    Habiuetine, in its pure form, is a known depressant used to soothe stress, anxiety, depression, and some eating disorders.  Side effects of Habiuetine may include drowsiness, loss of appetite, and minor loss of motor control.  Symptoms of withdrawal from Habiuetine have been observed to occur after halting intake of the substance after a one month period of constant use.  The withdrawal symptoms (at this level) have not been shown to be fatal.  However, 1 in 10 users of Habiuetine who did not experience a stress disorder before taking Habiuetine developed a trauma-related stress disorder after sudden discontinuation of the substance.\n\n    The signs of a moderate overdose cannot be detected until at least 14 hours after the intake of 24mg per kilogram of the user's mass.  A moderate overdose is physically unpleasant, with the first symptom to occur being a large, dry, flaky, and itchy rash on limbs, which will progress to dizziness followed by fainting.  The psychological effects of an overdose will leave a user feeling euphoric and impulsive, yet further use of Habiuetine before it has cleared a user's system could lead to a fatal overdose.\n    The fatal dose of Habiuetine is around 60mg, and can be detected very soon after ingestion.  The user's perceived euphoria becomes overpowering, there is a slow onset of complete numbness, complete loss of motor control, and, if a rash is present from the moderate overdose, it will begin to blister.  There are only preventative actions to be taken against a fatal overdose, otherwise, death is imminent within 14 hours.  The user, after a fatal overdose, will likely encounter seizures and finally succumb to cardiac toxicity.",

While users have noted the “pure bliss” of Spirit Honey use, most active users have been assessed to be ignorant of the observable physical consequences, as though there is a complete lack of pain and awareness of the substance's side effects.  Side effects of Spirit Honey are not fully understood as there has been no user to survive long term use, and clinical human trials are decidedly unethical.  Short-term side effects include a rash, slowed heart rate, and delirium.\n    \n    Spirit Honey is a gold-colored, translucent fluid.  In the 80s, it was discovered to be florescent, glowing under blacklight.  This has led to Spirit Honey vendors affixing blacklights in locations where Spirit Honey is consumed for aesthetic purposes.\u0000css\n\n    Spirit Honey is not commonly sold in a package.  Instead, dealers who synthesize the illegal substance commonly organize small gatherings where the substance is boiled and poured into a communal bowl.  This gathering is usually held in a small room to contain the fumes of the boiling Spirit Honey, which are said to give a temporary ego death, making the user feel a sense of \"total connection to the universe\".  After the fumes are inhaled, the bowl is passed around and sipped from.  Spirit Honey has been found to be more popular on planets with lower GDPs.",

Delavium renders the patient unconscious within moments, and the patient will remain unconscious for 12-16 hours.

This, as opposed to [!1 Unil] where numbers are little-endian.\n\n    Since Nunwei counting is in base-8, it means instead of having a 1's Place, 10's Place, and 100's Place, and so on like in Unil, it has a 1's Place, 8's Place, 64's place.\n\n    So, for some examples, if someone wanted to say \"321\" in Nunwei's numeric system, they would first convert it from decimal to octal (base-8), making it \"501\".

The sub-gallean structures create a facinating Violet glow through the ice; the city within has a reputation for its red lights.  The city of Heralius is one of the oldest known settlements on Gallea, with ancient fortifications circling around it in layers.  These layers are standing evidence of how far the settlement has grown since its origin.  In the center of the city, on the surface, a line of buildings can be seen high above the others on a rocky ridge.  This ridge is where the oldest buildings in the city, as well as government offices, are located.  It was founded by the influential Heral tribe around a now-dormant volcano in the center of the ridge.\n\n    The most notable areas in the city are the Government and Historic Districts, both having equally-artistic designs consisting of perma-ice, rock, and metals.  In the Ancient district, high on the ridge, are the original buildings made of perma-ice, and the ancient grand hall of the Heral tribe.  In the Government district, a massive complex of buildings extends from deep in the icy crust to high in the Gallean sky.  The Government Disctrict has a local garrison of the Gallean Army patrolling the large halls, as well as a small array of military spaceships that are ready to launch at a moment's notice.  The industrial sectors across the city are primarily underground in order to have their heat absorbed back into the planet, with high smokestacks penetrating the surface and high into the sky to release greenhouse gases.  The majority of the city's power is produced through Nuclear Fission in these industrial sectors.\u0000css\n    The city has changed hands many times in previous eras of [!1 Gallean history], and a keen observer can spot unpatched bullet holes and craters in the older and less-maintained sections of the city.  In fact, some irreversibly-damaged buildings from past wars have been built around inside the bases of newer buildings to preserve them to be examined by future generations.\n\n    The city's public transit system includes a complex of underground tunnels with [!2 maglev] trains traversing the city at high speeds.  These trains end or start their daily routes at the Central Station, underneath the Historic District, where trains and transports from across the planet’s surface depart and arrive constantly.  Above the ground, [!3 airships] directed by suspended guide rails ferry passengers, with [!3 skydocks] built into the sides of almost every highrise.  In the outskirts of the town, primitive land crafts and [!4 cars] travel on aging permafrost roads.  Typically, these vehicles are found in the industrial slums.\n\n    Being the capital of the [!5 Gallean State], the city has a hybrid military-civilian law enforcement system.  This system has been credited as the reason for the city's commonly-low crime rate.  However, as the red lights of the inner city fade into the orange of the industrial slums, the rule of law tends to lose its influence.  These areas have been nicknamed the Slumrals, and their residents, the Slumrats.",

The government has 3 major branches, The Workers council, The Military Council, & The Tribunal of workers.  Under the Gallea's Constitution each has its own separate powers: The Military Council has full control of military affairs; the Workers Council is a massive elected body of millions of citizens which decides civil laws or legislation as well as governance; the Tribunal is the central body, elected in a mass election, it has powers to settle disputes between both the Military Council and Worker's Council, and foreign and domestic affairs.\n    \n    Political parties on Gallea, more accurately called 'Unions', are the center of the political system.  These unions can be formed at any time by anyone, and are voted into existence by electoral districts for the council.  The same electoral districts determine which union of an area wins a specific vote.  The winning union then places some of its members into the won seats, traditionally into seats that represent home districts of the appointed member.  The Tribunal, however, is a winner-takes-all election, which does not follow district divisions and only votes by individual Gallean citizens in regards to voting people into power.  The chosen union then appoints members into the tribunal, with the Head Justice elected by the appointed members.\u0000css\n    The Tribunal of Workers is voted in by the public vote, with a head justice chosen by the members of the political union that won the last Tribunal Election, acting as head of state.  This branch has the most influential powers of the 3, having the ability to declare war, set domestic & foreign policy, sign treaties, take executive action, declare martial law in times of war or disaster.  The Tribunal also holds the impressive power to dissolve either the Worker's Council or Military Council, given a vote to do so passes in the Worker's Council.  The main duty of the Tribunal is to manage the national court system, and the judgment of national laws and military action.\n\n     At 564 million members, the Worker’s Council is voted in by local district councils of workers, separated into mostly-equal districts of 10 million people each throughout the nation.  The powers of this branch are; to write and vote laws into effect; veto decisions of the Tribunal; set the taxes and budget for all of the government (if a budget proposition fails to be agreed, on the previous year’s agreed budget will be used in its place).; set the naturalization process for immigrants; and agree on the mandate of any national expansion.\n\n    The Military Council is led by the High Admiral and High General of the [!1 navy(fleet)] and army respectively.  They are largely autonomous, but can be made subservient to the Tribunal.  The military has control over all military matters; the constitution leaves the military council’s role intentionally vague to be interpreted as needed.",

It's a hot world, with the poles sitting at about -32°C on average, and the equator usually reaching up to 40°C.  From space, Osirja is a rough ball of tan-brown sand and soil, with small, white ice caps on either pole.  Near the equator are two small freshwater lakes, both of which harboring small towns. \n\n    Osirja, since its colonization, has become a major economic hub of [!2 Bius Tu] and the GCP as a whole.  One by one, many large businesses have created offices and manufacturies there, which in turn, added a drive for more internal infrastructure on the planet, which only boosted the planet's economy further.  Most of the planet's business takes place in [!3 Liveston City], the capital of the planet.  There are other population centers on the planet, but they are dwarfed by Liveston in population, physical size, and economy.\u0000css\n    The majority of Osirja's surface around the equator is dirty deserts.  These deserts are largely infertile when untreated, and are commonly featureless save for hills and rifts in the earth.  These deserts are very sparsely populated by hardy plants of various [!4 vivotypes], whose seeds were brought by early colonists.  While the planet's flora may be sparse, it's fauna is even sparser; most wildlife can only be found in or around human population centers, living off the scraps and waste produced by the planet's inhabitants.\n    \n    Though Osirja has a sizable amount of water, most of it is locked into the planet's ice caps without very much water circulating in the rain cycle.  Osirja wasn't always this way, though; before any human contact, virtually all of the planet's water was frozen in its poles.  But over the years of Osirja's inhabitance, the global temperature has raised by a few degrees, which has melted some of the material of the ice caps.  In fact, the planet's lakes hadn't appeared until after human inhabitance had started.",

They assessed that the planet's temperature was adequate, but its atmospheric pressure and gravity where nominal at best, and with the high concentration of carbon dioxide, the air was unbreathable.\n    \n    Later, in 31, with the data gathered by the Deorian crew, a landing party was sent by [!2 Bius tu] to gather more data.  The mission consisted of a lander with an away team of four, and a warp-capable orbiter with a crew of five.  The away team stayed on the surface for 56 hours, measuring the planet's mostly-carbon-dioxide atmosphere and soil to determine which sort of plant(s) would be needed to make the atmosphere breathable.  The team then returned with their data.\n    \n    After contracting with the [!3 Transition Genetics] company, the Tuine team returned in 34 with a fleet of three [!4 spaceplanes].  Each of these planes' cargo bays was full of seed vials for a proprietary species of plant designed by Transition Genetics.  These seeds were sprinkled everywhere across the surface of the planet.  A team of three was sent down in a habitation module, intended to stay there for just over half of a [!5 galactic year] to monitor the status of the new vegetation as it grows and prepare for landings of future colonists.  This landing site's name, when translated from [!6 Tuine] to [!7 Unil], meant \"Osirja Prime\".\n    \n    In the year 41, the atmosphere had built up enough oxygen to be considered survivable.  After this, more habitation modules were sent down to Osirja Prime, each containing more colonists and more basic supplies.  From there, construction began on proper [!8 rocket fields] and the first permanent structures.  Using their supplies, they treated some of the ground around their encampment with nutrients to allow them to start cultivating crops.\u0000css\n    With promises of a new world to live on, colonists arrived in the hundreds through the years 42 to 49 as Osirja Prime expanded, bringing the population of the body to over 1,000.  In the midst of the [!9 Space Bubble], larger corporations began to see Osirja as more than just a backwater colony; given its opportune position in the middle of common [!10 GCP] space, the planet was (and still is) very valuable real estate.  One by one, companies started buying space to build offices, factories, and depots.\n    \n    From the years 52 to 93, Osirja's population extended greatly, transitioning from a mere colony to a full-on populated world.  In 57, the population surpassed one million, and the planet was ratified as its own province within the [!11 Tuine Government] (as opposed to still being considered a part of homeworld Bius Tu's provincial government).

Historians have determined that this chant originated from [!2 Itascus] during the [!3 Itascan World War].  Though, whether this chant was created by soldiers, or just by higher-ups for morale purposes is unknown.  While this chant is not the only marching chant to come from Itascus, it is the most broadly popular.\n    \n    \n    The modern chant goes as follows:\n    \n    \"→\" denotes a skipped beat\n    \"-\" denotes a word being spread over multiple beats.  (By default, each word is one beat)\n    \"A123\" is the singers' [!4 Platoon Tag], which, in this example is \"A123\"\n    Lines beginning with \"C: \" are sung by the marching leader.  Lines beginning with \"B: \" are sung by the rest of the marchers.\n    The number in parenthesis at the end of the line indicates how many steps (in the march) that line is spread over.\n    \n    C: [So] the days are long and nights are cold. (8)\n    \n    B: → The days are long and nights are cold. (8)\n    \n    C: [But] they can't take the fire from our souls. (8)\n\n    B: They can't take fire from our souls. (8)\n\n    C: [Now] they're com-ing down to take our stack. (8)\n\n    B: They're com-ing down to take our stack. (8)\n\n    C: But we'll kick each and eve-ry ass. (8)\n\n    B: → We'll kick each and eve-ry ass. (8)\n    \n    C: What will you be? (4)\n\n    B: A 1 2 3 (4)\n\n    C: Now who are we? (4)\n    \n    B: A 1 2 3 (4)\n    \n    C: E- → cho → (4)\n\n    B: In-di-go → (4)\n    \n    C: E- → cho → (4)\n    \n    B: Ter- → ra → (4)\n    \n    C: From the top →!

Though, the section adding the planet's abbreviation only started appearing in the 40s.  The \"Indigo Terra\" section is most commonly sung by members of the Itascan Space Fleet.  This is because national Itascans did not start culturally identifying with their planet until -after- their world war.  Originally, that section was something akin to the following:\n    \n    C: E- → cho → (4)\n\n    B: One two three → (4)\n    \n    C: E- → cho → (4)\n    \n    B: A B C → (4)",

We use degrees instead of a unit of measurement for distance because it remains consistent regardless of the planetoid's size.\n\n    For any given point on a planet's surface, its Latitude describes its position along the planet's axis of rotation(north/south), while its Longitude describes its position perpendicular to the planet's axis of rotation(east/west).\n\n    Latitude is denoted by a number ranging from 0 to 180, with 0 being a planet's South Pole, and 180 being the planet's north pole.  A point having a latitude of 90 would mean that it is on the planet's equator.  This measurement only goes from 0 to 180 (as opposed to 360) because it only describes a point's position \"up and down\", and not all the way around.\n\n    Longitude is denoted by a number ranging from 0 to 360.  Since no point on a planet's surface can inherently, definitively be the 'start' of a planet's land.  Thus, a point on the surface is arbitrarily defined as the planet's 'longitudinal origin' by its inhabitants (or discoverers).  This origin marks which point, east to west, on the planet's surface is longitude 0.  If you were to go west from this point, your longitude would underflow and loop back over to 360 (since the planet is a sphere).  If you were to go east, your longitude value would increase more the further east you go.  If you were at a longitude of 180, it would mean that you're on the side of the planet opposite of the planet's Longitudinal Origin.",

Instead, kianrui-hood is decided by popular opinion, and whether or not a kianrui's name and advancements are remembered after their death.  Typically, someone is crowned as a kianrui if they have invented or pioneered something influential.\n    Despite this, the crowning of new kianrui in La'Foyan culture has slowed to a near halt in the -30s.

They originated in the great plains of La'Foy, and were the most complicated culture of their time.  Because if this, they played a large part in [!2 La'Foyan History].\n    \n    Based on recovered records from that era etched in stone, it is believed that Proto Ruitai had a very poor understanding of disease.  By noticing that larger villages were more likely to be wiped out by disease, they erroneously concluded that sufficiently-large collections of people were cursed, and doomed to die mysteriously.  This number was decided to be exactly 81; they believed that a population of this number or greater in a village would cause the population to die suddenly and mysteriously.  In fact, the ancient Nunwei word for plague, \"Sabisa\", directly translates to '81' in [!3 Nunwei].\n    \n    Village-wiping diseases were seen as curses of pure evil, and something to be avoided at all costs. Because of this, sufficiently-large villages would split in two, with one half staying and the other leaving to create a new village, likely never seeing their original village again.  Because of this phenomenon, complex La'Foyan culture was able to more-easily spread across the planet.\u0000css\n     As the Proto Ruitai encountered outsiders as they spread, they would commonly observe that the outsiders' villages had populations exceeding 81.  In these cases, the Proto Ruitai tribe would avoid the outsider tribe altogether, or attempt to fix the population of offending village themselves.  In the case of the latter, the Proto Ruitai tribe may attempt to communicate with the foreign village.  Though, this approach rarely worked, as the other tribe would have either a vastly-different language, or no proper language at all.\n    In other cases, special warriors known as Sabisari would raid the offending village, killing members of the tribe at random to decrease the population to a suitable level.  These warrior would wield axe-like weapons called [!4 Sifaku] on these raids.  Written records from that era indicate that they had thought that this act helped the villages, while in reality, this likely only crippled the communities.",

She was very in-touch with the [!5 Surari] of the region she lived in, and pioneered [!6 Surari-Human relations].  Some historians postulate that Ama had actually made up her own name, because she may have forgotten the name given to her by her birth parents. \n\n    Most written records, as folklore surrounding her, state that Ama was actually raised by Surari.  According to Ama herself, she separated from her biological parents at the age of five [!7 local years] (~5.55 [!8 Galactic Years]).  She was allegedly then discovered by a family of Surari, which had raised her from that point.  At the age of 10 local years (~11.1 Galactic Years) she reestablished contact with the local villages of humans.  Popular folklore says that Ama was trying to find her birth parents, but this is not definitive.\u0000css\n    All surviving reports describing Ama's personality concur that she was perceived to be very strange by the humans she interacted with.  She was reluctant to eat prepared food, would refuse to wear garments, expressed discomfort entering buildings, and hated being touched.\n    Her understanding of the local human language, [!4 Nunwei], was rudimentary, leading to difficulty expressing herself to other humans.  While speaking, she would sometimes use chatters or yips in the place of words; these vocalizations were believed to be [!5 Surariwei signals].  Unsurprisingly, her stature was described as being very Surari-like.\n\n    Ama's Surari family began drifting further from her local village at the age of around 11 local years (~12.22 Galactic Years).  Locals attempted to convince her to stay with other humans, but she was adamant that she had to stay with her family of Surari, and that being with other humans was undesirable.  After that point, she was never seen again.  She is believed to have died as she lived: among the Surari of the Bingko woods.\n    \n    Ama was crowned as a [!1 Kianrui] centuries after her death; Surari taming had changed the course of [!9 La'Foyan history], and La'Foyan culture honored her for the advancements she pioneered.  In fact, the Nunwei word for riding a mount, \"Janu\", is derived from her name.  \"Ama\" later became a popular name on La'Foy starting in the -1,800s.",

From feet to the top of the head, Surari are 2.2 meters tall, with their ears extending up to another 30 centimeters from their heads.  Surari are almost 3 meters long from snout to flank, with their tails being anywhere from 0.2 to 0.8 meters; the dimensions of a Surari's tail can vary greatly depending on its place of origin.\n    The body of the Surari is covered almost exclusively in a modest pelt of fur, which is thinner on the face and feet.  The pelt's palette can vary based on the location the Surari is found in, usually being a shade of brown, orange, or amber.  Some specimens, found in cooler, polar climates, have light grey, or even stark-white coats.\u0000css\n    The face of a Surari closely resembles that of its human cousin species, the [!2 La'Foyan Race], though the face of the Surari is much broader and longer; their snouts are long, jutting out around 35 centimeters from the face.  Their muzzles are well-defined, being almost flat on the top and bottom, with the muzzle itself being 16 centimeters wide at the end and about 20 centimeters wide at the base.  This large oral structure is attributed to being related to the Surari's instinctive hunting style: latching onto larger pray with their large maws and sharp teeth to keep their meals from escaping.  Despite the similarity to their sapient cousins, Surari do not have dark patches of fur around their eyes.\n\n    Surari are remarkably cognizant for their kind, almost having a general intelligence.  The word for a collection or pack of Surari is a \"family\", as in \"a family of Surari\".  Wild Surari live in packs of five to forty.  Because of this, Surari are very social creatures; studies have shown that Surari are able to recognize and remember the faces of other Surari and La'Foyans alike, attaching unique perceived personalities to each face in their minds.  Surari families are alloparental, meaning that the matured members of a pack collectively care and provide for all the young of the family, regardless of if a specific Tira (word for preadult Surari) is the direct offspring of the adult providing care.\u0000css\n    Surari have shown to be capable of very simple learned language skills; Surari have been observed in the wild to emit howl-like vocalizations for communication, which can be intelligibly heard from up to 8 kilometers away.  The cadence, pitch, and frequency of these howl patterns determine their meanings.  Interestingly, these specific howl patterns are not sourced from the being's instincts, and are in fact learned from other beings around them (almost exclusively other Surari).  Each family of Surari has been found to have a specific \"family call\", which is a howl pattern specific to an individual family used to rally the pack or locate lost members.  As well as howls, some arrangements of short yips or chatters can be made to have vague meaning, used when Surari are communicating face to face.  These chatter-yips are usually relegated to more \"interpersonal\" communications, such as expressing hunger, a request for a mate, expressing fatigue, or other short-range exchanges of information.\n    A region can have its own unique \"Surari language\", with specific, unique howl and chatter patters associated with useful exchanges of information such as alerting others of threats, informing others of nearby prey, and other useful details.  The word for a Surari regional language is \"Surariwei\", and a unique vocalization carrying a specific meaning is called a \"ra'weic\" or \"signal\".\n\n    A common Surari is hostile to most all beings encountered that are smaller than it; Surari hunt and eat practically any creature they can take down.  Though, surprisingly, hostility from Surari towards La'Foyans (or other species closely related to La'Foyans) is remarkably uncommon.  This is accredited to the Surari's facial recognition capabilities mentioned previously.  This phenomenon extends to non-La'Foyan species of human, but usually to a lesser extent.\u0000css\n    Surari have two documented physical sexes: \"male\" and \"female\".  The dimensions of a Surari's tail are correlated to the creature's physical sex, and are the only outwardly-observable divergent feature of the species' sexual polymorphism.  Females' tails are large, round, and bulbous, being teardrop-shaped at around 0.7 meters long and around half a meter in diameter.  The ends of females' tails, about the last 20 centimeters, are a different color than the rest of the Surari's body, being a shade lighter or darker.  The tail of a common male Surari, on the other hand, is long and shaggy, being up to a meter long and of uniform color (the same color as the rest of the creature's pelt).  The hairs on the bottom of a male's tail look comparatively emaciated, flaying out underneath.\n\n    Surari and human La'Foyans have had a very productive relationship.  In fact, the [!3 relations between La'Foyans and their Surari] have been very impactful, even measurably effecting the course of [!4 La'Foyan Natural History].",

        "data": "css\n    The Surari have played a few important parts in [!1 La'Foyan History] as companions, mounts, and beasts of burden.  Many ancient La'Foyans, those who lived on [!2 La'Foy] before the year -2,800 P.W., believed Surari to be another, simpler type of human -- another subrace of La'Foyan.  This is thought to be due to the similar facial structure between the La'Foyans and Surari, rendering Surari easily anthropomorphized by the La'Foyan People.  In fact, the word \"Surari\" is derived from the La'Foyan words for \"person\" and \"beast\".\n    \n    In ancient times, interactions between [!3 Proto Ruitai] tribes and families of Surari were largely uneventful.  Though, some fossil records recovered on the borders of the La'Foyan Great Plains and the Bingko Forests illustrate families of Surari slain with human tools, and tribes of La'Foyans raided and killed by Surari jaws.  But, these violent interactions were rare; the Surari were not vilified, and they continued to live in relative peace.\n    \n    La'Foyan folklore contains countless stories of human children wandering off from their villages only to be taken in by families of Surari.  But, these instances were, and still are, incredibly rare.  On the other side of the coin, there are reports of lone young Surari encountering Proto Ruitai villages and being allowed in to live their lives as little more than pets among the village humans.\n    \n    In the -2,800s, new Surari-human interactions were pioneered by one of the first La'Foyan [!4 Kianrui], [!5 Ama Januko].  Ama was a La'Foyan of the Bingko forest, said to have been raised by Surari.  Ama taught the people of the Bingko forest how to make Surari more comfortable with human presence.  Surari of the region became closer to humans, leading to more symbiotic relationships.  Specifically, ancient La'Foyans' problem solving skills synergized well with the speed and strength and the Surari, making them very desirable hunting partners.\u0000css\n    Ama later taught the Bingko people how to ride Surari, which proved to be quick mounts; Surari were, and still are, able to move much faster than a standard human.  Surari riders, known as Januri, took their new knowledge of Surari with them as they traveled.  Though it was still remarkably difficult, knowledge of Surari taming and riding spread from the Bingko Forests to the La'Foyan Great Plains and Biu'ngan Swamps.  This new knowledge was quickly instilled into the tribes of these areas.\n    \n    Surari became parts of the lives of ancient La'Foyans all across the planet over the next century.  At this point, many tribes began to see Surari as sources of utility.  Surari were gradually used for more applications; breeds of Surari were eventually made to fill the purposes of faster mounts, pets, and even beasts of burden.  Docility and lethargy was bred into many of the breeds of Surari we now know today, making them more dependent on their human caretakers.",

        "data": "css\n    Retroskip Pitching is an audio data manipulation method used to digitally raise the pitch of an audio stream while preserving its duration.  Retroskip Pitching is a very computationally-simple process, meaning that it takes very little processing time to perform, so little that it can even be done in real time to live audio streams.  But, this pitching process can audibly distort sound through raising the pitch.  It's very easy to discern, by audio alone, if a track has been Retroskip Pitched.  This is because Retroskip Pitching is not a lossless process, meaning that some audio fidelity and definition is lost through using it.\n\n    Retroskip Pitching is actually a name used to describe a two similar processes: \"Skip Pitching\" and \"Retrograde Pitching\".  Both of these methods use many of the same fundamental functions.  In Retroskip Pitching programs, there are two primary parameters used to define how the audio should be changed: the \"Sample Interval\" and the \"Sample Repeat\".\u0000css\n    When audio is run through a retroskip pitching program, the track is first cut into numerous smaller samples based on the Sample Interval parameter.  For example: if the track is 10 seconds (10,000 milliseconds) long, and the Sample Interval is set to 0.25 seconds (250 milliseconds), the program will divide the track into 40 quarter-second samples (because 10 divided by 0.25 is 40).  After the track is divided into samples, the program then compresses the length of each sample to be shorter than it was originally.  This part of the process references the Sample Repeat parameter.  Specifically, the program shortens the sample by a factor of Sample Repeat.  For example: if Sample Repeat is set to 4, the sample will be sped up to be 4 times shorter than -- one fourth the duration of -- the original sample.  After this, the sample is then repeated the same number of times as the factor it was shortened by in order to be the same total length as the original sample (ex: if the sample was made 4 times shorter, it would be repeated 4 times).  If the process is Retrograde Pitching, every other repeated sample would be played in reverse.  Some think that reversing every other sample creates a slightly \"smoother\" sound.  If the process is simply Skip Pitching, none of the samples are reversed.\u0000css\n    Finally, the process joins all the samples together in their original order, which creates the final audio stream.  The final audio stream is the same length as the original, but has been altered to be a higher pitch.\n\n    Retroskip Pitching is an ancient method of audio manipulation, having been independently invented on many worlds prior to the invention of [!1 Warp Drive].  It has since been made obsolete for its intended purpose by other, less lossful methods of modulating pitch, such as Frequency Isolation.  Though, Retroskip Pitching is still in wide use in modern times, either for vanity reasons, for reasons of real-time pitch modulation, or for setups with limited computer resources.  Some manipulate the settings of Retroskip programs in certain ways to make songs sound remarkably different in a method called [!2 Skipjacking].\n\n    When used on live audio streams, Retroskip Pitching is latent by one Sample Interval.  This is because these programs require a sample to be recorded before it is repeated.",

Skipjacking is sometimes applied to a person's voice in media (to make it appear alien or robotic), but is mainly used in music of the [!2 Echobeat] genre.\n\n    Skipjacking is simply the intentional misconfiguration of a [!1 Retroskip Pitching] program.  Specifically, in Skipjacking, the program's Sample Interval is set to a comparatively-long period (upwards of 100 miliseconds).  This creates a distinguishable \"skipping\" effect in the audio, because the Sample Interval has been made long enough that listeners can audibly discern the looping of the sound.\n\n    Some Retroskip Pitching programs themselves have been modified into programs made specifically for Skipjacking.  These programs can be made to make the Sample Interval and Sample Repeat parameters change midway through a track (usually in an [!2 Echobeat] song).  This can be done to give a section of a track audible emphasis, or to change certain parts of songs.\n    Skipjacking Programs are commonly made to \"miss\", as in refraining from repeating, certain sections of the track at a regular interval.  This feature is usually intended to allow an operator to align the \"Miss Interval\" with a song's downbeat, which helps to preserve the rhythm.  This is so the \"beat\" in a song won't be skipped.\n\n    In Skipjacking, a song or instrument's Sample Repeat may also be referred to as its \"microtempo\".  The reasoning behind this is that it's sort of a sub-beat, or \"the beat within a beat\".",

        "data": "css\n    Echobeat, sometimes called \"Doubletime\" or \"Retroskip Music\", is a style of music characterized by heavy use of [!1 Skipjacking], which is a method of audio manipulation derived from [!2 Retroskip Pitching].  Some consider Echobeat to be a musical genre of its own, but many musical professionals seem to agree that Echobeat is too broad to be labeled a genre, and that it would be more accurate to instead call it a 'style' of music.\n\n    Echobeat songs primarily feature intentionally-blatant artificially-raised-pitch audio.  Second to the pitch, a characteristic of Echobeat music is a \"glitchy\" aesthetic.  More specifically, Echobeat artists employ the ideas of malfunctioning audio hardware and corrupted sound data into their personas and bands.  Though, in reality, calling Echobeat music \"corrupted\" is a misnomer; the auditory effects present in said songs are intentional, and commonly require meticulous, precise work.\n    The most common audio manipulation process used in Echobeat music is intentionally misconfiguring [!2 Retroskip Pitching] programs, a practice known as [!1 Skipjacking].  The application of Skipjacking raises the pitch of a song's audio (while maintaining its tempo and time signature), but also creates an audible skipping effect.  The program is sometimes also configured to add random variations in a song's skipping pattern, giving it a more \"glitchy\" sound.\n    Skipjacking is applied, in this instance, by aligning the Skipjacking program's Sample Interval with the tempo of the song.  This makes the Skipjacking process synergize with a song's beat, and many Echobeat fanatics claim that this adds an interesting layer of complexity to the music.  This, combined with the song's raised pitch and datamusic-esque demeanor, has led to Echobeat music being very popular among niche groups of related interests.\u0000css\n    The majority of Echobeat music, upwards of 65% of all tracks, is in the form of edits of pre-existing songs.  Tracks such as these are more akin to remixes; artists of these tracks take a pre-existing digital recording of a song (typically one from [!3 popular culture]), and fine-tune their Skipjacking software to perfectly align with its beat.  The artist may then make additional changes to the track to enhance the listening experience and/or further differentiate it from its source material.  The final result is a song that is of the Echobeat style of music, but the song it is mixed from is still recognizable.  Tracks such as these are popular in small pockets across the [!4 Silver Stream], and on numerous small gatherings on [!5 the Internet].\n\n    The rest of Echobeat music consists of original songs explicitly composed in the Echobeat style.  Entirely-originally-produced Echobeat music has some perks over Echobeat music produced through remixing.  For example, an original artist would have all the stems (individual instruments and vocals) of their song.  With these, an artist could apply Skipjacking to every element of the song individually (or apply no skipping on certain elements entirely).  This means that the individual instrumentals (and vocals) of many originally-composed Echobeat songs are differentially-skipped.  This can add another layer of complexity to a track, as the different Sample Intervals (meaning different microtempos) of the stems can be made to align and synergize with one another.\u0000css\n    Echobeat music first arose on [!6 Erii] in the 43rd [!7 Galactic Year].  It was originally produced by a duo band of musicians which was named \"Doubletime\".  Originally, Echobeat music was simply called \"Retroskip Music\", named after the audio manipulation method its made with, [!8 Retroskip Pitching].  On Erii, Echobeat music experienced some minor popularity, but its scene could have been described as \"underground\".  Doubletime released two albums and went on tour across Erii before disbanding in the year 47.  After that point, Echobeat largely faded into obscurity.  Some time in the 60s, while the majority of this style of music was being produced through remixes (meaning few original songs), the style took on the name \"Echobeat\".\n    On the 3rd of Bloom, year 78, [!9 Data 4] appeared, a [!10 Deorian] band of four with a passion for Echobeat music.  In total, they produced three albums, had four tours, graced Deoria's Top 8 lists five times.  This band believed to be what let Echobeat peek into the mainstream, instilling it into popular culture.  Data 4 disbanded and retired in 85.  In 96, [!11 The Echo Dolls], an [!12 Armalite] Trio, released their first album.  They aren't incredibly popular; most communities on some planets haven't even heard of them.  But, they are very popular in some places on the [!5 Galactic Internet], with devoted fans of theirs making pilgrimages to Armalai to hear their live shows.  As of today, The Echo Dolls are still an active band.\n\n    Despite being heavily reliant on digital manipulation, Echobeat music is actually able to be played live.  Though, this is not without its hurdles; there are many challenges that can deter live musicians from preforming Echobeat songs, such as the inherent delay of [!2 Retroskip Pitching], the disconnect between an artist's raw voice and the musical vocals, and difficulty for new Echobeat musicians to adequately hit their notes (due to the disconnect).\u0000css\n    To remedy this, many musicians instead opt not to listen to the live Echobeat music they're playing.  Instead, they use personal audio devices (such as headphones) to listen to the raw, unprocessed sounds of the instruments and vocals making up the song.  However, many artists disapprove of this method; some musicians insist that this method is lacking, and keeps someone from truly connecting to the music they're making.\n    \n    A few performers, called \"Echobeat Purists\", have made adaptations (or just simply trained long enough) to be able to listen to their music whilst playing it.  Some performers have trained for long enough that they can keep proper time and tune, even while listening to a delayed, filtered version of one's own sound.  This has some benefits over listening to one's own raw audio (as opposed to not listening to the final audio).  For instance, performers who actively listen to the same audio stream their audience is hearing can better make adjustments to their live performance; they can detect and fix problems that arise from things such as becoming out-of-beat with their Skipjacking program's Sample Interval.\n    \n    When performing Echobeat music live, its very important that an artist's tempo stays the same as that of the Skipjacking program they're running their audio through.  This is important because, if a song's downbeat drifts from the Skipjacking program's [!1 Miss Interval] (an interval that's intended to be aligned with a song's beat to preserve the rhythm), it can make the song sound truly, directionlessly, corrupted and distorted (which, many agree, makes the song much less appealing).  In Echobeat terminology, becoming misaligned with the Sample Interval is called \"Going lame\", ex: \"I think you're percussion is going lame every time we get like two minutes in\".\u0000css\n    There are many solutions to this problem.  For instance, a band may opt to have a metronome playing in their headphones.  Though, if the band is of Echobeat Purists (meaning they likely prefer not to wear headphones while performing), they may instead only have one member (usually the percussion musician) wear headphones with a metronome, with the other musicians of the band trained to follow that person's beat.  The band could also opt to just automate the process, and employ a [!13 computer] to produce a beat at a steady, unchanging interval.\n    There is another method of keeping time, known as \"Beat Flashing\", that doesn't make use of sound for maintaining the tempo.  Instead, the artists train to follow the beat of a light that flashes at a set interval.  This light may only be seen by the performers, or it may be incorporated into the audiovisual display of a show to enhance an audience's experience.",

        "data": "css\n    Qi-Induced Microstructuring, or just Qi Microstructuring (abbreviated as \"QIMS\" and commonly pronounced as \"chims\" by professionals), is a method of changing the microscopic crystal lattice of a crystal (commonly a type of quartz).  QIMS technology is used in everything from [!1 computer memory], to [!2 laser weapons], to sensors, to [!3 solar cells].\n\n    QIMS technology was initially, independently discovered by the [!4 Tyventians] and [!5 Deorians] in ancient times.  In the 30s, proper studies were conducted regarding the exact functionality and uses of QIMS on [!6 Bius Tu].  From there, many discoveries were made regarding how Qi Microstructures function, and how to better apply them in technologies.\n\n    Creating a Qi-Microstructured crystal requires something called a Structure Seed.  This seed is the nucleation point for the growing microstructured crystal, and acts as a sort of \"template\" for the rest of the material in the crystal.  For instance, the microscopic structure of the Structure Seed is repeated and copied throughout the rest of the crystal as it grows, with the entirety of the final crystal being made up of repetitions of that tiny structure.  Note, crystals only form around seeds via repeating Microstructures if the environment they form in has a high amount of ambient [!7 Qi Energy].  If its environment does not have sufficiently-high amounts of Qi energy, the crystal will form into a standard, natural crystal lattice.\u0000css\n    Notably, Qi-Microstructuring a crystal (as opposed to letting it grow naturally) usually drastically reduces the tensile strength of the material.  This is because, in functional applications, the functionality of a Microstructured crystal holds priority over its structural integrity.  On the molecular level, this is because growing the crystals in unnatural patterns leads to fewer connections being made between the atoms in the material, which subsequently leads to a weaker material.  The amount by which the material's tensile strength is reduced can be anywhere from 0% to 90%.\n\n    Since Qi Microstructures determine the crystalline structure, they subsequently determine the overall shape of a formed crystal.  For manufacturing purposes, these crystals are made to be cubic.  If the crystals are cubic, its much easier to determine where a crystal should be cut.  This is because the microstructures within a cubic crystal are perfectly aligned in a three-dimensional grid, making them very easy to machine.  If a crystal that was intended to be cubic is warped, or is another shape entirely, it is an indicator that the microstructure was \"encoded\" incorrectly; if a microstructure is incorrectly encoded, then the best thing a manufacturer can do is scrap the crystal and reuse its material for a new crystal.\n    Most all crystals made for industrial or functional purposes are cubic, but crystals made for other implements can have other shapes.  For example, Microstructured crystals made for artistic applications can be made in many different intricate formations.  Crystals made for implements involving [!8 Qi Invocation] exist in a variety of unusual shapes, as these crystals are (usually) not intended to be machined or align with mechanical parts.\u0000css\n    A fully-formed plate of Qi-Microstructured crystal is known as a \"wafer\", and is usually cut to be very thin.  They made thin (between 20 to 40 micrometers) so that a wafer will contain only a small number of layers of the Microstructures within.  Though, many wafers are made thick enough that they contain multiple layers of Qi Structure.  This thickness is measured with a unit known as \"Structure Layer Count\", or \"SLC\".  Ex: if a wafer has an SLC measurement of two, it means that its thinnest dimension is wide enough to contain two layers of its Microstructure within.  Some Microstructures are designed in a way such that the crystal's material will easily sheer away, layer by layer.\n    \n    Some certain patters of Microstructures interact with [!7 Qi Energy] in useful ways.  For example, certain Microstructures, when fed Qi Energy, will emit light in a specific direction (based on its design).  A microstructure such as this is useful for creating laser [!9 beam emitters].\n    Most technologies that make use of Qi-Induced Microstructures require multiple layers of different wafers stacked on top of eachother.  Occasionally, the wafers are also cut into small slivers and layered on eachothers' sides, as well as being put in other strange arrangements.  Once the wafers that are meant to interact with each other are aligned with one another, the entire set is encased in a hard resin or enamel.  This is to increase the strength of the arrangement.

        "data": "css\n    Qi-Mediated Remote Pressure, abbreviated as \"QMRP\" (and sometimes pronounced as \"Chirp\"), is a method of pushing an object or material from an extended distance without making physical contact.  Most notably, QMRP technology is used in [!1 Drifsam Diversion Cannons].\n    \n    Specifically, Qi-Mediated Remote Pressure is a technology used to apply pressure to objects over an extended distance without direct physical contact.  At its most basic, a QMRP applicator can be pointed at any object or material, given power, and the object or material will be pushed away from the QMRP device in the direction its pointing.\n    \n    A QMRP applicator can be imagined as beam emitter, emitting a line in the direction it is pointing.  Any matter this beam hits, including scattered materials, normal objects, or even air, will be pushed away in the exact direction of the beam, regardless of distance.  Of course, the applicator is also pushed in the opposite direction with an amount of force equal to that applied to the target.\n    \n    QMRP applicators are made through [!2 Qi-Induced Microstructuring] of Potassium Dichromate Crystals, with the microstructured crystal having a Structure Layer Count of eleven.  This means that QMRP applicators are usually very thin, less than a centimeter in width.  The majority of QMRP applicators are made to be circular.\n    \n    The amount of force a QMRP applicator is capable of applying is directly proportional to its area.  This means that the wider an applicator is, the harder its able to push.  Due to this, different sizes of applicators have garnered different names.  An applicator less than a centimeter in diameter is referred to as a \"die\"; one greater than a centimeter, but lesser than six centimeters, in diameter is called a \"chip\"; one greater than six centimeters in diameter is called a \"plate\".\u0000css\n    Qi-Mediated Remote Pressure was first discovered on [!3 Deoria] in the -50s through [!2 microstructuring] discoveries.  Among these discoveries were [!5 Flow Crystals], whole, natural crystals constructed out of QMRP-applying microstructures.  Though, these crystals were used only as inefficient fans, and their full utility wouldn't be realized for decades.\n    \n    In the 30s, through [!2 microstructuring] advancements, Flow Crystals were being studied and refined.  At this point, Flow Crystals were being cut into Microstructure wafers with Structure Layer Counts of just one.  This low layer count made the applicators very weak, meaning that they could not push very hard.  At the time, the technology was called \"Flow Wafer\" technology, and dismissed as being nothing more than another technology to make fans.\n    \n    Through the 70s to the 80s the [!4 Vectorate company] performed further research and development on Flow Wafers.  They had realized the potential applications of QMRP technology in space.  They managed to evolve a breed of microstructured Potassium Dichromate Crystal to allow eleven layers of QMRP microstructure to \"shoot\" through each other, effectively making QMRP devices eleven times stronger.\n    This breakthrough made QMRP technology viable for use in [!1 Drifsam Diversion Cannons].  Shortly after its invention, the technology was licensed to the [!5 Itascan Government] for cleaning up the aftermath of the [!6 Apocalypse Collision Incident].",

This tends to occur over an extended period of time, and generally in locations with high Qi concentration. Somehow, a Structure Seed or something similar had found its way into an organism’s internal ecosystem. Over a period of time, the bio-crystal gathers material and absorbs Qi energy, thus growing larger and larger, potentially replacing whole organs during its crystallogenesis. \n\n    IMBCG, for much of its development, will only cause everpresent, but slowly increasing, food cravings and mineral deficiencyies as the crystal draws from the materials the patient consumes.  IMBCG crystals also absorb the ambient [!2 Qi energy] of the infected in order to grow.  Normally, this would impair an infected person’s ability to maintain homeostasis.  But, it ultimately has limited effects on an individual's homeostasis.\u0000css\n    Most commonly, individuals contract the disease by living in an area with high concentrations of [!3 uncharged Qi Particles].  Environments such as these supplement their own levels of charged Qi, and subsequently that of the bio-crystal.  If the infected were to relocate to a less uncharged-qi-dense location, they may notice weakness across their body, as the IMBCG crystal within them would be taking a larger proportion of their body's energy.\n\n    Notably, some individuals have found themselves healthier (in some respects) after a few years of being infected, as some breeds of bio-crystals can prove beneficial as storage for Qi energy.  This means they can act as batteries, or sorts, and making the body's level of Qi saturation more stable.  Though the effect is limited, as accessing this storage for purposes other than that of their natural biology is not inherent to individuals.\n\n    Aside from the side effects of the process of growth itself, the structure that the bio-crystal grows into also has its own symptoms, due to the crystal's random formation creating random breeds of [!1 microstructure] crystals.  Often, the bio-crystals grow into and replace biological matter, taking up the shape, size, and location of an organ. Some tissue samples from IMBCG amputees have found the area around the amputated limb taking on a near lattice-like protein construction similar to Microstructured Crystals.  The exact symptoms vary depending on where the crystal manifests, but often, they are not apparent until days before death, or if the bio-crystal had grown into a visible body part.\u0000css\n    Another common symptom of IMBCG is [!4 Qi overheating].  The patient's body will have the same amount of Qi energy saturation as a healthy individual.  But, since many microstructured crystals have a higher level of Qi capacity than their component materials, the crystalls usually greatly increase a patient's Qi capacity, which subsequently raises the body's amount of resting charged Qi.  As a result or raised ambient Qi levels, higher amounts of energy in a patient's body is converted to heat, which can cause a variety of issues related to heat exposure.\n\n    If the bio-crystal forms somewhere deep in the body, IMBCG can be difficult to detect until it is too late to treat.  Despite the crystalline structure often replacing many vital organs, it has more limited effects on the skeletal and nervous system.  The bio-crystal can replace bones rather easily.  Whereas, while their replacement of the nervous system and parts of the brain has negative side effects, they noticeably reduced (as compared to manifestation in other organs).  The disease's effects are a result of crystal often replacing biological matter, as opposed to just building into it.\n    An autopsy of one victim, performed on [!5 Gallea] in the year 63, had revealed that their parietal lobe was somehow nearly-entirely replaced by IMBCG bio-crystals.  In spite of that, until days before their death, they had most of their pain, visual, and tactile sensory input still intact.  Another individual, in 89, had to have their hand amputated after they had discovered that they had a massive, aggressive, invasive IMBCG bio-crystal in their palm through recieving a cut.\u0000css\n    The only way to treat IMBCG, assuming that it was uncovered while it could still be treated, is to remove the growing bio-crystal.  This usually involves invasive surgery, or even amputations.\n\n    Interestingly, there has been research undertaken in third-world nations and backwater worlds to enhance Qi conjuration through principles related to IMBCG.  Essentially, people have made rudimentary attempts to graft Microstructured Crystals to individuals to enhance their bodies' Qi energy storage.",

Featurally, Matina is also mostly uninteresting.  Scientists surmise that Matina had a very active geology in the past.  Due to this, many spanning, massive mountain ranges and sharp trenches cover the surface.  And, since Matina has no atmosphere or hydrosphere, these rugged surface features have persisted over the millions of years since they were formed.\n\n    Matina is a dead world, having no worthwhile resources to gather.  In total, there have been less than a dozen surface expeditions to Matina, most of which didn't last very long.  Over the last century, a few plans have been proposed to establish settlements on Matina, many of which suggested constructing the colonies in the deepest trenches for protection from the elements.  Though, these settlement proposals have been ignored due to the lack of usable, life-sustaining resources on and under the surface.\u0000css\n    In 72, a public fund was established to place a monument to the invention of [!1 warp drive] onto the surface of Matina.  The fund raised $4,425,000 in [!2 Itascan] money.  A 20-foot statue depicting [!3 The Pioneer] was commissioned on [!4 Erii], and a delivery crew was hired to place the monument on the highest peak of the tallest mountain of the planet, to commemorate the invention of warp drive.\n    \n    The planet is actually named after the mother of [!5 Kane Felt], who was one of the pioneers to perform the first interstellar warp relocation.

        "data": "css\n    Once [!1 Maritus], an old country of [!2 Itascus] that existed before the [!3 Itascan World War], had finalized the very first fully-functional, long-distance [!4 Warp Drive], they needed to begin experimenting with their new technology.  They had been testing their newly-discovered warp technology for years.  The drives they had developed at that point had a max warp speed of only about 16c.\n    \n    In -3, the Itascans had created a test ship with warp capability.  This ship, a small, two-person vessel capable of warping at 15c, was named The Pioneer.  Specifically, this ship was built by Itascan scientists to test if human interstellar travel was even possible.  This ship was the first known spacecraft ever to be constructed to warp across interstellar-distances.  Thus, the ship's warp drive itself was connected to a plethora of measuring equipment designed to record the state of the warp drive as it traveled.  The crew aboard the Pioneer was 15-year-old [!5 Fits Henton] and 19-year-old [!6 Kane Felt].\u0000css\n    The Pioneer's mission was simple, outlined by the following:\n        First, they were to depart from Itascus's surface with standard solid-fuel rockets.\n        The ship was stocked with 33 weeks (10890 hours) of supplies and life support for the crew of two.\n        They would then charge their warp drive and orient their ship towards [! Sol]'s nearest stellar neighbor, [!7 Eralux].\n        The warp relocation would take 10 weeks (3300 hours) with constant warp at 15c.\n        Upon arriving at the foreign star system, they would exit warp.\n        Then, they would locate the fourth planet from the star, [!8 Matina], and attempt to warp into its Sphere of Influence.\n        Upon entering the sphere of influence of the planet, the crew was instructed to burn into a high orbit.\n        From there, the crew would take advantage of being near a never-before-seen world and, spend most of their time taking readings and photographs of Matina.\n        The crew were instructed to warp back to their homestar after 30 hours studying the alien planet.\n        The return warp took the same amount of time as the first warp, 10 weeks (3300 hours).\n        After returning into orbit of Sol, the ship would radio to Itascus that they had returned, and wait for a go-ahead to warp back to the planet.\n        Upon warping home, the crew would bring The Pioneer into a low orbit of Itascus.\n        A small [!9 Transit-Class ship] would be sent up from the surface of Itascus to rendezvous with The Pioneer.\n        The Transit-Class Ship would retrieve the two astronauts and the Pioneer's warp drive, bringing them back down to the surface for recovery.\u0000css\n    When actually enacted, the plan succeeded.  The crew successfully performed an interstellar warp, orbited an alien planet and returned.  But, the excursion was not without problems.\n    During the warp back to Sol, about three weeks into the route, Kane Felt started experiencing severe Cabin Fever, as well as moderate psychosis.  Kane's condition is thought to have been brought on by a severe sense of [!10 Artemecia], caused by contemplating the idea of being one of the first two people of his species to travel interstellar distances and see the world of another star.\n    Fits Henton was interviewed about Kane's complication after he returned to Itascus.  He said that Kane had been talking about \"the stars\" and \"the scale of it all\" for weeks prior, ever since they had left the orbit of Matina.  He states Kane started acting strangely and despondently, often neglecting his daily exercises and forgetting to eat.  Fits worried that Kane might \"do something dangerous\" mid-warp.  Fits was allegedly able to talk Kane out of his fell mood, returning him to an operational state.\u0000css\n    Despite their turbulent journey, The Pioneer safely returned to Sol and entered into a low orbit around Itascus.  Upon recovery, the two astronauts were debriefed.  Upon learning about Kane's psychosis episode, the [!11 Itascan Space Agency] (then called the Maritine Space Agency) submitted him for a psychiatric evaluation, though, the evaluation found Kane to be perfectly mentally healthy.\n    Once The Pioneer's warp drive was recovered, it was promptly dismantled and extensively studied.  This was to determine if interstellar warps were sustainable, and if warping for extended periods of time caused damage to a warp drive, or caused the [!12 Aptha] within to become unstable.  The tests concluded that extended-distance warps were sustainable, with minimal loss of Aptha via warp.\n    \n    These events directly led to the [!13 Warp Endowment Campaign], fully bringing warp technology into the hands of the people of [!14 The Silver Stream].",

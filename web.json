The Deorian specimen is bipedal, with B-Type bodies.  Deorians are covered in body fur, with colors ranging from crimson to cyan (fur color is determined by genetic factors).  In addition to their body fur, Deorians have longer hairs growing from their heads and tailbones, giving the appearance of common hair and tails.  The color of these longer hairs are typically a darker shade of their body fur tone.  These hairs are thicker and longer than the hairs of their body fur.  Deorian tails consist of no flesh or bone, simply being a long bundle of hairs stemming from their lowermost parts of their backs.\u0000css\n    Like all known species of human, Deorians heavily rely on unique facial structures to identify others.  Compared to other species, the face of a Deorian is notably unique.  Like other life of the [!1 Daerus] vivotype, the eyes of the Deorian face are notably large.  While the average diameter of other humans' eyes is two to three centimeters, the adult Deorian eye is five to six centimeters.  Regardless its size, the Deorian eye has a unique appearance.  The Sclera of a Deorian's eyes are light grey, but gradually turn dark brown as they age.  The iris color of of the eye can come in about a dozen different, shimmering colors, mostly determined by the ethnicity of the subject.  Most notably, a Deorian's pupil is shaped like a rounded triangle.  The rotation of each eye (meaning the rotation of the triangular pupil) is apparently completely random, determined at conception; even genetically-identical twins are born with different pupil orientations.\n    As for the rest of the face, the mouth and nose are built into a short snout, which is about half the height and width of the face as a whole.  The snout extends four to six centimeters out from the rest of the face, making a sort of muzzle.\u0000css\n    In terms of their overall bodies, Deorians have typical B-Type frames.  Deorians' limbs are of average width and girth, but the muscle bundles are more defined under the skin.  Some scientists think that this detail is due to Deorians coming from a world of moderately-high gravity (1.62 G).  Being of B-Type bodies, their legs have two major joints (as opposed to one); the first one is the forward-facing upper knee, which is just \"the knee\" in F-Type bodies, and the backward-facing lower knee, which is a variant of \"the ankle\" seen in F-Type bodies.  Overall, this divides the leg into three, equal-height sections.  From a side view, the upper-most third of the leg is quite wide, spanning 35 to 43 centimeters front to back (as it's full of muscle), while the lower-most third (right above the foot) is comparatively thin, only about 10 centimeters in diameter.\n\n    Deorians' hands and feet are hoof-like, being made of hard, enamel-like bone.  Deorian hands consist of four free-moving cloves, all of which being opposable, functionally making them relatively undexterous, though unusually powerful, fingers.  All four fingers of an adult Deorian are seven to nine centimeters long.  On average, a Deorian has 600 to 700 newtons of grip strength in each hand.\n    Deorians' feet are structured similarly to their hands.In the foot, three of the cloves extend forward from the \"ankle\" by about 20 centimeters, while the fourth faces backwards to act as a heel.  The clove of the foot which acts as the heel is much wider than the three in front.  Unlike those of the hand, the three cloves making up the fronts of the feet are fused together at the bases.  This makes the foot much stronger, though less dexterous.\u0000css\n    On the tops of their heads, each Deorian has a pair of natural antlers. At birth, these antlers are little more than nubs.  Though these antlers start to grow beginning in adolescence (five to ten [!2 Galactic Years]), and thereafter grow continually until death.  The patterns and shapes of the antlers vary from person to person, predetermined by one's sex, age, and ethnicity.  Tests show that Deorians are genetically coded to connect human identities to antler patterns in the same way they perceive hair.  The antlers of Deorian males can grow to rise between 15 to 50 centimeters above their head, while females' can grow up to 70.  Many Deorians shave down or even shear off their antlers for cultural reasons, convenience, personal choice, or aesthetics.\n    \n    The Deorian species has only moderate sexual polymorphism.  Most notably, female Deorians are, on average, 18 centimeters shorter than males of the same species, 145 to 154 centimeters on average, while males stand at 168 to 177 centimeters.  Conversely, the antlers of a common female Deorian tend to be about 20 centimeters taller than that of a common male.\n    For reproductive reasons, females' waists are slightly wider.  This difference is mostly imperceptible to other human species, but Deorian brains are built to be better at recognizing the difference.  While Deorian males have a shoulders-to-waist ratio of about 7:6, females have a ratio closer to 1:1.  Finally, male snouts extend six centimeters out from the rest of the face, while female snouts only extend four centimeters out on average.\n\n    The Deorians, as a species, have been quite successful.  They are the dominant species on their homeworld of [!3 Deoria], and have traversed endless space to propagate their kind across the stars.",

They are efficient, tall, and bulky, with a thick fur coat and fat under their skin that has made them extremely adept in surviving cold environments, such as that of [!2 Gallea].  Their arms are noticeably longer than their legs, with hands made up of 4 digits.  At the tip of each finger is a claw; once used for digging through hard ice, these claws may be utilized as formidable weapons.  Their heads Are round, and their eyes face forward flatly.  A 14-to-19-centimeter-long snout protrudes from it, ending with an almost flat nose.  This snout curves slightly down into the muzzle.  The concave orientable ears of the Galleat can, at full height, be as tall as 13 to 20 centimeters.  Typically, these ears are lightly curled and pressed down flat on the tops of their heads for better heat retention, but they are able to perk up to their full height for higher audio fidelity.\u0000css\n    Protruding from the midlength of the side of the skull, Galleates bear a pair of boney horns; Galleat horns are large and curled, and the shape of these horns curve outwards from the head in a slight spiral downwards, the inner curve closely follows the fur coat, with their tips ending near around the same height as the muzzle, just below the horns' origins. The bone around the base of the horn is thicker and reinforced to take force laterally and vertically.  Galleat horns are found on both males and females\n\n    The coloration of Galleates almost exclusively consists of mute colors, with bold colors accounting for very rare mutations.  The underlying skin itself is grey.  Their horns are perhaps the most colorful portion of their body; as as an adolescent, they are a muted turquoise, and as one matures, the bases of the horns grow more purple, forming a unique gradient. This change in color can mainly be attributed to the blood vessels growing into the base of the horn.  Their eyes come in shades of navy blue and purple.  The function of the Galleat horns is initially believed be as a defensive structure against predators, which overtime became a tool for Galleates to compete over territory, resources, and mating partners.  Their use in modern contexts can be found in [! Horns in Galleat Society].\n\n    Galleat blood is fairly darker than most other human species, due to very large amounts of Hemoglobin-analogous metalloprotiens, resulting in a dark purple color.  It is theorized this adaption was made out of a need to extract as much oxygen as possible from [!2 Gallea's] atmosphere, especially within Gallea's numerous mountain ranges.\u0000css\n    The differences between male and female Galleats are not extremely various, but still noticable.  A female specimen's horns are generally thinner, with smoother textures.  Structural traits in female Galleats not present in their male counterparts include more abdominal fat, and structural adaptions to deal with Cualt-raising, Cualt-birth and conception such as developed breasts and wider hips.  Hands of female Galleates are also larger by a small amount, with more concave claws.  During pregnancy, the Female Galleat will grow a longer coat and slowly lose pre-pregnancy fat, in a near 1:1 trade-off with the womb's growing volume. The end result can be barely noticable or even entirely imperceivable until after birth.  The cause of this change, or lack thereof, is the fat abdominally breaking down and being transfered to the fetus.  It's widely accepted that this is to give the cualt full protection from the enviroment of Gallea at birth.   Post-pregnancy the female Galleat retains their longer coat, and their frame is permanently thinner than it was prior.  By eating a regular diet, their fat distribution will eventually return to natural amounts.\n    \n    Adult galleates should consume ~15,600 kcals a day to maintain a healthy body weight.  This large caloric intake is thought to be the driving factor in Galleat populations being stunted.  The large amount of calories needed is also thought to have driven the smaller litter counts and the loss of the specimen's second pair of breasts.  Galleates do not consume this full amount daily and instead feast once or twice a week.  Galleat diet tends to favor fish, salted or smoked meats, dairy, and varied bitter greens.  The preferred flavor palleate of a Galleat tends to favor salted, dried, or smoked flavors, with bitter tastes as accents.  A notable exception is very sweet dairy and pastry products, which Galleates tend to be fond of as a contrast to their hardier meals.",

Like most humans, the La`Foyan is bipedal, with a B-Type body.  La`Foyans are covered in full coat of body fur of variable thickness and color (dependant on the subject`s environment/genetics).  These coats can be brown, orange, red, black, or white.  La'Foyan fur is naturally water-resistant; water that touches the coat beads up and bounces off the hairs thanks to a naturally-produced oil.  La`Foyans have short snouts, meaning their noses and jaws extend forward from their faces by 7-9 cm.  On the upper rears of their heads are large, concave, front-facing, orientable ears.\u0000css\n    Since La`Foyans are a properly-sentient human species, they are capable of dynamic problem solving, long-term memory retention, and other factors which qualify them as having a general intelligence.  Like other humans, the La`Foyan is a social, communicative creature.  The most common form of communication in modern, civilized La`Foyans is spoken/written [!2 language].  The oral structure of a La`Foyan mouth is adequate for speaking most human languages.  The most commonly spoken language among vivologically-La`Foyan individuals is some dialect of [!3 Nunwei].\n\n    Regarding their anatomy, La'Foyans have mostly-typical B-Type bodies (B-Type meaning the primary joint in each of their legs is backwards-facing).  Specifically, La'foyan legs have two joints and three main segments -- the first segment, the upper leg (in an adult specimen) is approximately 30cm long and connects to the person's hip; the second segment, the mid leg, is also around 30cm long and connects to the upper leg with a bending, front-facing joint (knee); and the lower leg (which is analogous to the midsection of the foot in F-Type bodies), 20cm long, connected to the mid leg at the top with a backwards-facing joint, and connected to the specimen's foot at the bottom.\n    La'Foyan feet are digitigrade, meaning they walk on their digits (toes) as opposed to their heels.  Compared to other human species, La'Foyan feet are small, being only about five centimeters wide and seven centimeters long.  La'Foyans have four primary toes at the front of the foot -- each terminated by a claw -- and one rear toe that has evolved to adopt a shape, position, and functionality more similar to a heel.  The La'Foyan heel boasts a small, wide, hooked claw, typically concealed under the foot.  La'Foyans instinctively use this claw for climbing.\u0000css\n    Similar to their feet, a La'Foyan hand has four primary digits, and a smaller, opposable digit further back.  La'Foyan hands are furred all over, with exception to their fingertips, which each have a small patch of darker, firmer skin.  This is likely to help with precision grips, as skin has considerably higher traction that fur.  Even though they had evolved from paws, La'Foyan hands are still just about as dexterous as any common human manipulative appendage.\n\n    Like most large mammals of the [!4 Feiraus] vivotype, La'Foyan humans exhibit only subtle traits of sexual polymorphism (meaning different sexes bearing divergent outward traits).  La'Foyan humans are [!5 Caudadimorphic], meaning the only outwardly detectable sign of their physical sex is in their tail.  The La'Foyan tail, on both males and females, has a 60-centimeter flesh-and-bone core.  In males, the tail's fur is emaciated and downy, conforming more to the general shape of the tail's core.  In females, however, the tail's hair is much more volumous and buoyant, creating a large, round, bulbous tail with a pointed end.\n    \n    Not unlike other humans, La'Foyans are [!6 Faciocentric], meaning they instinctively use others' facial features and expressions for identification and nonverbal communication.  The La'Foyan face is formally defined as the full-width (~21cm) front side of the head.  A common La'Foyan has two small eyes (~2.5cm in diameter) just above their muzzle.  Encircling each eye is a patch of dark fur (darker than their pelt, or even black).  The patch is circular (or at least rounded) with the inner side (the side closer to the middle of the face) starting encircling the eye, and extending outward (away from the middle of the face), away by 4 to 8 centimeters.  The sizes, shapes, and colors of these symmetrical eye patches, combined with general facial structure, are instinctively used by La'Foyans for visual identification of other individuals.\u0000css\n    Disregarding the projected muzzle, the La'Foyan face is relatively standard for a human species.  The mouth of any (healthy) adult La'Foyan has 24 teeth.  The four frontmost teeth (top and bottom) are incisors, while all but the rearmost eight teeth are cuspids.  The eight teeth in the back of the mouth are molars.  La'Foyans infants are born with only their cuspid teeth, the incisors being absent to allow for feeding.  At around one [!7 galactic year] of age, the incisors of a juvenile La'Foyan will grow in, followed by their rear molars at around eight years of age.\n    \n    For its size, the La'Foyan body can be remarkably agile.  Due to having low body fat, a strong grip, thin limbs, and an instinct for climbing, it's relatively easy for a La'Foyan to hone their skills in agility.  These predispositions can be linked back to when the La'Foyan species diverged from the [!8 Kori] species -- a species of small, tree-inhabiting, low-intelligence humanoids.\n\n    A majority of the La'Foyan species of human exists on only four bodies, two of them being the planet [!1 La'foy] and its moon [!9 Armalai], among other [!10 La'Foyan State] territories.  Most races of La'Foyan thrive in warm, humid climates.",

They are bipedal and bear B-type bodies.  Common Tyvants are covered in a thin, sleek coat of fur, which may display various colors and unique patterns.  Common Tyvant fur can range from shades of orange to brown to reddish, and typical fur patterns include stripes, spots, splotches, and socks.  Tyvants also have a thick tuft of fur on their heads, which is commonly grown out, groomed, and styled.  Tyvants have two relatively small, curved, front-facing, orientable ears that poke out from the top of their heads.  They have rounded, modest snouts, jutting out just a few centimeters from the face, which hold many pointed, though somewhat dull, teeth.\u0000css\n    Their eyes are about 6.4 cubic centimeters in crossectional, and have thin, slit-like pupils.  Their irises tend to be dark hues such as black or brown, though exceptions do exist, and their sclerae are yellow and have a shimmering effect in the dark, commonly misidentified as luminescence.  Most notably, Tyvants have two stalky antennae upon their heads, located somewhere in front of their ears, and a long, dexterous tail which, uniquely, can fan out at the end.  Both of these traits are considered unusual for furred creatures, and especially for sapient ones, as there has never been a single other sapient species recorded to have had either antennae nor fan-like tails as Tyvants do.  \n\n    Tyvants thrive in hot, moderately-humid climates, and the majority of Tyvants live under such conditions.  However, it is noted that Tyvants do have the ability to adapt naturally to the cold: there is a direct relationship between Tyvant fur growth speed, length, and temperature.  When it is cold, Tyvants grow their fur out faster and longer than when the weather is hot.  This winter coat sheds when the weather is warm again, but if it remains unhealthily cold for a Tyvant over a longer period of time (for example, on [!2 Gallea]), the thick fur remains.  A Tyvant`s legs are digitigrade and have two joints, the first being 43 cm below the hip, marking the end of the haunch, bending forward, and a second joint 32 cm above the foot, bending backwards.\u0000css\n    Tyvants bear unique tails which have the ability to spread apart like a fan at the end, revealing a display of bright-colored fur that stretches out to be up to a square meter in area.  The purpose of this adaptation was likely to serve as a way to intimidate and stun prey whilst hunting (or startle threats in self-defense), especially in packs, where several Tyvants would be able to fan out their tails at once.  It has been historically popular for Tyvants to customize their tail-fan designs throughout their history in ways ranging from simply dying and artificially patterning the fur to attaching piercings and other forms of jewelry to the tail.\n\n    Tyvants, as most sapients do, communicate primarily through spoken language.  Their mouths are shaped similarly to most other humanoids, allowing them to properly speak most human languages, although they iconically tend to have what could be described as a certain “snarl” when they speak most non-Tyventian languages, especially in rapid or casual speech, regardless of their native tongue.  This is due to the way a Tyvant`s tongue is positioned within the mouth, resulting in perpetual growling which can be suppressed by holding the tongue rigid in the mouth.  As a matter of fact, most [!3 Tyvant languages] are noted to contain phonemic growling.\u0000css\n    Tyvants may also subconsciously communicate utilizing pheromones; they release various pheromones under certain conditions, which linger in the surrounding air for varying amounts of time, depending on the pheromone released and its quantity.  On [!1 Kayan] especially, due to the humidity of the air, these pheromones remain suspended in the air for much longer than in more arid climates.  These pheromones are, for the most part, odorless, but can be detected by a Tyvant`s antennae.  There are five pheromones in particular which Tyvants may release and perceive in this way. These are: a pheromone which indicates severe danger or fear, the release of which is triggered by either a spike in heart rate and blood pressure as a result of the fight-or-flight-or-freeze response or alternatively whenever the body enters rigor mortis (albeit this rigor mortis-related response tends to not occur in individuals who die past their middle age); a pheromone which indicates the accomplishment of a task, whose release is triggered by the stimulation of a Tyvant`s brain`s reward circuit; a pheromone which indicates shock or sadness, whose release is triggered by a sudden drop in the hormones responsible for happiness within a Tyvant`s brain; a pheromone which indicates lust in females, produced by female Tyvants during mating periods; and a pheromone which indicates attraction, produced by male Tyvants during Tyvant mating periods as a response to the positive reception of female lust pheromones and the physical attractiveness of the female in question; the male mating response pheromone indicates to the female that he is at least biologically willing to engage in intercourse.  Each of these respective pheromones has served a specific role in aiding the proliferation of the Tyvant species throughout its history, and are still of good use to the species in the modern era, particularly the latter two, which are necessary for the Tyvant reproductive cycle to take place.\u0000css\n    On the topic of the Tyvant reproductive cycle, Tyvant mating periods are based on whenever an individual reaches their age of sexual maturity.  Upon reaching this age of maturity, Tyvants begin to experience mating periods which last approximately one [!1 Kayan] month each every six to seven Kayan months.  While they are able to reproduce year-round, the process is streamlined whenever one is in heat.\n    Disregarding the previously-mentioned pheromone factors, mating periods in females are highlighted by the accentuation of ones breasts through subconscious flexing, increased sociability, and irritably flaring their tails.  In males, the mating period involves the display of irrationally bold behaviors, such as the loss of inhibitions and potentially violent competition with other males for mates.  Both sexes also experience elevated heart rates and an aversion to dry weather while in heat.\n\n    Evidently, the automatic Tyvant pheromone responses have a tendency to become rather disruptive to ones daily life, especially in the modern era.  The historical solution to this has been, and still is, the burning of a unique incense derived from the bark of a certain equatorial tree native to Kayan whose fragrance binds to and thus blocks Tyvant pheromone receptors.  This incense can be described as having a smoky, almost fruity scent on its own, though it is frequently paired with other materials and substances when burnt to produce alternate scents.\u0000css\n    Tyvants are considered to be psychologically communal, preferring to remain in relative closeness with one another.  From an evolutionary standpoint, this was likely meant to influence pack hunting behaviors.  Also, it is noted that many Tyvants bear relatively strong self-discipline, though it is currently partially ambiguous as to whether this is a result of biological factors or socio-environmental factors.  Recent studies done by [!4 Transition Genetics] do show some correlation between genetic factors and the aforementioned behaviors, but it is yet to be definitively proven that the two variables are related.\n\n    From a visual standpoint, Tyvant males and females are best distinguished by the females bearing a larger hip-to-shoulder ratio and two milk-producing breasts.  Unlike the mammaries of most other species which grow enlarged milk sacs, Tyvant breasts are rather muscular, making them firm and more body-conforming than those of other species.  This prevents them from becoming a setback in activities such as hunting or swimming.  In terms of internal physiology, Tyvant females produce sex-unique lust pheronomes during their mating periods and Tyvant males produce attraction pheronomes as a response to the female pheronomes, as previously mentioned.  Other than that, there are no other significant differences between the Tyvant sexes unique to the species compared with the other known sapient species of the galaxy.\n\n    The first Tyvant civilization appeared to have begun somewhere on [!1 Kayan] roughly 2,700 galactic years ago, evidenced by the large presence of prehistoric artifacts found near the equator which date back to that time.  It is believed that the species eventually began to migrate via boats to the other continents, populating the world in its entirety.",

The state in power wishes to keep its population constant, as evidenced by its [!2 policies on immigration and population control.] Armalai's surface, while naturally barren, is very colorful; typically a collage of reds, oranges, yellows and blues. The city lights of buildings typically consist of the same vibrant colors, brightly visible from orbit, making the planet seem to sparkle when viewed from the dark side. In recent years, a few bodies of water have started to appear in low lying areas due to the atmospheric conditioning of the planet over the decades of its inhabitance.\n\n    To decrease the spread of foreign pathogens, and to allow for more efficient record keeping of transactions, foreign spacecraft are only allowed to land in specified areas. These areas are treated as buffer zones, and require proper documentation and [!3 clearance] to leave and enter primary Armalite lands. Capital Square in the capital city, [!4 Lightfire], is a special landing area, used only by very important landing vehicles (such as those of national leaders) and only in specific time frames.\u0000css\n    Armalai has made a reputation for itself as being a prominent source of consumer media of all varieties. Combined, the Armalite industries have a disproportional market share when in comes to consumer media. This is accredited to the planet's swift adoption of [!5 Unil], as most creative material from Armalai is written or produced in the galactic language.\n\n    The Armalite [!6 Time Table String] is \"R-0:00T ZT 1Y/9L/37D/4W/10T/100d\". Armalai's local time system is heavily based on that of its orbital parent, La'Foy, as it was established when Armalai was still a La'foyan colony. But, because Unil has been a popular language on Armalai since its introduction, the Unil names for units of local time were quickly adopted by the population and were officially standardized in the year 89.\n\n    Notably, all tapwater found on Armalai contains a standard dose of [!7 Ferilin] for population control.\u0000css\nThere are three classifications for areas on Armalai:\n      \n    Primary areas:\n        These areas are the entertainment focus on Armalai. They contain things like restaurants, theatres, salons, spas, museums, gift shops and other convenient outlets that tourists would need. Primary areas are typically very stylized and visually appealing.  There are sometimes citizen apparel guidelines for while they are in these areas, though they are not mandatory.  Primary areas are littered with discretely placed humidifiers to keep the air comfortably breathable, as opposed to Armalai's typically-waterless atmosphere.\n    \n    Secondary areas: \n        Secondary areas, informally known as “backstage”, are typically reserved for low rank civilian housing, goods manufacturing, and citizen amenities, such as grocery outlets, doctors' offices, studios, etc. There is a clear distinction between primary, and secondary areas; secondary areas have a severely decreased focus on aesthetics. Secondary areas are by no means unappealing, they are simply appear as any other urban area. There is no regulation on passage between primary and secondary areas, though it is difficult without knowing an area layout; many city planners design roads and zones in a way to silently guide people who aren't intended to visit secondary areas (ex: tourists, news crews, etc.) to stay in Primary ones.\n        \n    Wilderness:\n        Wilderness covers the majority of the body's surface, and consists of dunes, what little farmland Armalai has, and some small bodies of water. For some more developed cities, such as Lightfire, there are short, snugly-fit walls between wilderness and developed areas with doors at regular intervals. There are many potential reasons as to why the walls are built; some say that living next to the open desert can make citizens uncomfortable, the walls make the inside of the city slightly cooler, or that they're simply more aesthetically appealing.",

The planet was not influenced much by the Urran Invasion of 89, being a simple colony. But, since the dissolve of the Urran empire, the colony has fallen into a state of relative disarray.\n\n   Most of the populous on Uterku is spread over the body in small groupings of less than a thousand in small towns commonly referred to as \"communities\" And are almost all self-sustaining. Communities are usually built around natural resources, such as water, forests, or valuable minerals. While communities have everything a civilian would need to survive, they hardly ever have [!2 rocket fields] or [!3 shipyards], meaning that civilians looking for import/export must travel to a local megacity, all of which have space infrastructure.\n\n   Journalists have recorded a few notable developments in the last few months regarding order on the body. Many communities have been observed to be maintaining order and upholding (community-defined) laws. But, these communities prefer to separate themselves from other communities. This combined with their inability to launch ships has led to major isolation.\n\n   Communities have been largely peaceful with one another. This is mainly due to Urra confiscating civilian weapons. But one growing faction, the Grey Styx, has raided the weapons out of many old Urran military bases in the area around the planet's old capitol. The group is believed to have control over at least 50 communities, with no known central headquarters.",

Said busses can usually be used by civilians upon paying a small fee and run in the [!3 Transport Circuit, Supply Circuit, or Homeworld Circuit].\n\n   Privately owned Warp Ferries commonly charge a moderate amount for use, but can boast shorter, more specific circuits for cargo and the likes.\n\n   Warp Ferries were conceptualized by the [!4 GUN] as a solution to the growing demand for transportation between planets which were vast distances apart, with warp cores being unthinkably costly for a civilian even then. So, Warp Ferries were proposed shortly after the creation of the GUN by the nation that was then known as Ghilly as a cost-effective plan for transportation.\n\n   Warp Ferries work by hosting a great number of docking ports of all types for ships to connect to. On these ports, only the connection is functional, meaning that docked ships cannot share power, fuel or passengers with the ferry. Once the ship is ready to depart, it warps to the next [!5 astroport] on its circuit, charging a small fee to each boarded ship for each jump made.",

Suits of Power Armor can weigh up to a metric ton.  Suits of Power Armor, needing power, have either massive battery banks or compact generators on the back or shoulder.  Suits that are not intended for combat may have their power sources on their chests.\n\n   Power Armor spacesuits, due to their lack of powered limbs, are not technically Power Armor.  Though, they are still considered such due to the wider range of sensors, and having a very high resilience for a space suit.\n\n   The most popular application of Power Armor throughout time has been combat. Power Armor has proven to be almost indispensable in battle, with its most recent use in large-scale warfare being the [!4 Urran invasion] of [!5 Tyventia]. \n\n\n   There are two common variants of Power Armor: F-Type and B-Type. Each variant is meant for a certain body type, a user is incapable of properly equipping a suit of Power Armor if it does not match their body type. \n\n   F-Type, standing for \"Front\" or \"Forward\", has front-facing primary leg joints.  This armor can accommodate plantigrade users with front-facing knees.  These users include, but are not limited to Itascans, Tuines, and Galleats.\n\n   B-Type, standing for \"Back\" or \"Backward\", has back-facing primary leg joints.  This armor can accommodate digitigrade users with a rear-facing lower knee, with or without a front-facing upper knee.  These users include, but are not limited to La`Foyans and Tyvants.",

The back of the torso opened “like a book”, with two vertical panels opening outward. Both the legs opened in tandem with above panels. The armor was opened via a lever just below the back of the neck Drivers were intended to first reach their arms into the torso and slide them into the arms of the armor, also moving their head into the attached helmet. The driver would then step into the legs to fully dawn the armor. Once the driver was inside, the armor would power on, activating the actuators and allowing the driver to move with the assistance of the actuators. The armor would be closed either by an exterior assistant, or by the driver jutting their arms back to physically shut the doors. A design flaw in Mk. 2 power armor is that drivers found it very difficult to reach the lever on the back to open the power armor themselves, often requiring assistance from someone else.\n\n   The Mk. 2 is where power armor adopted its “bulky” aesthetic, being the apparent thickness modern power armor is today. The surfaces and plates on this version of power armor are smooth and rounded.\n\n   The battery on these suits could last though up to 46 hours of use, being a small improvement over its predecessor.",

        "data": "css\n   Currently, there are primarily three theories that predominate origin discussions\nacross the [!1 GCP]:\n  - Panspermia \n  - Naturalism\n  - Interventionalism\n\nPanspermia\n     Theorized in year -7 by [!2 Doctor Maebelle], Panspermia theory is the most plausible in the eyes of the broader scientific community. Panspermia theory suggests that the similarities between all life is due to a single source of DNA being spread across the galaxy countless years ago. The exact method of which is currently undetermined.\n\nNaturalism \n     Most predominately presented and supported by Entropists. This theorizes that the universe naturally guides life towards a specific form as is simply the nature of things. Whether it's due to life only being able to exist in this form, or the influence of a greater power is debated. This difference, while both still being part of the Naturalist Origin view, has caused a divide in its believers.\n\nInterventionalism \n     The most divine of the three and by far the eldest, Interventionalists are typically from many religious denominations, despite their personal disagreements about the true origin of the world, they all agree that the world was made in image of a higher being that wished for the world to be so. Interventionalist religions are as old as history itself, the idea even spawning independently on isolated worlds.",

Itascus is a lunar world, coated with oceans populated by a few specs and swaths of land, scattered along the surface like dust in the wind.  Since Itascus's fauna is of the [!2 Itaus] vivotype, the plant life covering the planet's land masses is light green in color, contrasting well with the world's light blue oceans.\n    Unlike most other lunar worlds, Itascus still has a very active geology.\n     \n    From a distance, the planet has a blue sheen around it due to its tall atmosphere.  From the surface, the sky appears to be a light cyan-blue, with deep red sunrises and sunsets.  The Itascan atmosphere is even thick enough that nighttime views of the cosmos appear slightly hazed. \n\n    Due to its proximity to its orbital parent, Itascus is tidally locked to [!3 Skoth], meaning that one side of Itascus is always facing the gas giant. On this side, the temperature is lower than the average for the planet, the middle most part of it being in a state of eternal winter.  Sometimes, this part of the ocean can become cold enough that its surface freezes over, creating a \"third ice cap\" on Itascus.  The area in which this temporal icecap manifests is known as \"Umbrea\".\u0000css\n    Itascus' [!4 Time Table String] is \"N-10:00T ZT 1Y/12L/18D/20T/40d\".  The point on Itascus's surface which always faces Skoth marks the [!5 Longitudinal Origin] in the [!5 STP System] for this planet.\n\n    Itascus has three primary landmasses over its surface, each of which being an [!6 Itascan Governmental Province].  These are the Ferika Continent/[!7 Capital Province], the Aphoterra Continent/[!8 Far Province], and the Kullmia Continent/[!9 Kullmi Province].\n    Ferika is located 90° east of the Umbrea ice cap, and takes up 14% of the surface of the planet.  Throughout Ferika are many mountain ranges, with various plains, valleys, and deserts strewn between them.  Along the east coast of Ferika is an extensive, deep geological fault line.  Tectonic shift along this fault line over millions of years has caused the southern half of Ferika to be long and strait-like, almost reaching Itascus' South Pole.\n    Cutting through the northern half of Ferika is the Nerona River.  Fed by hundreds of smaller streams and creeks throughout the northern half of the continent.  The Nerona River is large enough that it's easily visible from space, being a distinct part of the continent's outline.\u0000css\n    Aphoterra and Kullmia are opposite of Ferika, 90° to the West of the Umbrea ice cap.  These two continents are adjacent to one another, with Aphoterra being due north of Kullmia.  On the east-most side of the pair of continents is the Aphokull Land Bridge, which is 322km long and 108km wide.\n    Apoterra's edges are made up of plateaus, plains, and sheer coastal cliffs.  More inland, on the west side of Apoterra, are great plains on shallow, treeless soil, thought to be caused by the movement of long-gone glaciers.  On the Eastern half of Apoterra's inland is home to hilly woods and thick forests covering medium-height mountain ranges.  Apoterra exists over 9% for the planet's total surface.\n    The Kullmian continent is much more rugged than its northern neighbor.  On the eastern and western faces of Kullmia are extensive mountain ranges, spanning from the northern to southern shores.  In the middle of these mountains is the vast Kullmian Desert, which sees virtually no rainfall throughout the year.  Kullmia takes up 11% of the planet's surface by area.\n    The ocean area separating these continents, called the Aphoterra Bay or Kullmian Bay (name varies by location), divides them by 429 kilometers at its thinnest and 728 kilometers at its widest.\n     \n    A common sight on Itascus is [!10 airships], being a popular mode of travel both between and within cities. Many skyscrapers in densely populated areas have [!10 skydocks] for airships on their higher stories. For urban travel, it's not uncommon to see civilians riding and driving [!11 cars].",

In 96PW, a group of hackers made a program called [!1 Colorblind] which allowed CGOS programs to be run on GOS.\n    \n    CGOS was reported to be slower than GOS. This is thought to have been due to the extra stress of producing full-color program windows. CGOS had less WorkRAM available to programs because of the extra memory the OS itself takes up, meaning that more time had to be spent moving running program data to and from memory and the disk more often.\n    \n    Despite its drawbacks, CGOS was still a popular operating system to the public.

Uudil is a deep orange/red with white, icy streaks along the surface. The atmosphere makes a faint, purple shell along the surface when viewed from space. The Uudilian skies are mostly clear of clouds; a majority of the water on the planet is frozen in scattered ice sheets.\n     \n     Due to the placement of ice in low, level areas, Uudil is thought to have once had small oceans on its surface millions of years ago. Now, the oceans are deep, comparatively flat ice sheets.\n\n     Uudil was initially a colonization project of the [!1 Itascan] government in 38PW. Itascus sent many warp-capable ships with many kinds of Itascan fauna. No Itascan plant species was able to take to the cold, thin atmosphere of Uudil. The project was abandoned. Later, in 42PW, a private [!2 Galleat] organization brought Galleat fauna to the red planet. They took almost immediately. The fauna spread over the planet like mold on a bun. Due to Galleat fauna's dark coloration, the planet's albedo decreased by over 40% just under two years. This caused a massive heating that killed off most of the plant life. Eventually, the planet settled at a stable temperature, with a stable amount of plant life. Now, the average landscape is the planet's natural deep red, with the occasional grey fern or tuft of grass on the ground.\n\n     Due to its poor atmosphere, many people on the surface commonly have to wear [!3 respirators] of some kind, having a low oxygen content in the air.",

Ghilly is grey-brown, mountainous rocky planet with a thin atmosphere. Ghilly has a very high orbit over its parent, taking up only 0.23 degrees in the Deorian sky.\n\n     Despite its size, Ghilly still has an active geology. This explains its mountainous surface and frequent earthquakes. \n\n     The thin atmosphere of Ghilly means that many people require the use of [!2 respirators] while performing extraneous physical activity. Physical activity in the ambient atmosphere can lead to dizziness, unconsciousness, or even acute Hypoxemia. Most public indoor areas have [!3 Atmosphere Conditioners] to boost the Oxygen content of the air inside.\u0000css\n    Due to the combination of Ghilly's low gravity, frequent earthquakes, and high metal richness, its architecture has taken on a unique style. Most structures are made of primarily iron and steel. Most small/medium structures are suspended between one to even ten or more meters above the ground. Greater heights are more common in more densely developed areas, with some buildings even suspended above others. Buildings are typically suspended by metal spring bar tubes, or other types of suspension from the ground. Most buildings have access stairs or ramps for easy access. Most ramps are from the ground to the base of the building, though for some very tall structures, they're connected between the base and other buildings or common catwalks.\n     \n     Ghilly's [!4 Time Table String] is as follows: \"N-8:00T ZW 1Y/16L/32D/4W/4T/24d/24p\". Ghilly's local time system is almost entirely based on that of Deoria, with the only discrepancy being the number of days in a lunen. Since Ghilly is a lunar world, orbiting another planet, its time system's year is not based on its orbital period. Instead, it's based off the orbital period of its parent, Deoria.",

Because of this, Atmosphere Conditioners require their back ends to be exposed to the ambient atmosphere of a planet, and their front ends enclosed in the indoor space they're conditioning.\n\n     To function, AtCs do not require the indoor area to be airtight, though less air openings in the space to make the system more efficient.\n\n     Atmosphere Conditioners are open-system appliances.

The revolver is one-of-a-kind as it is encased in a new light weight and heat resistant material; silicone aluminum (SiAl). There revolver itself is a break action handgun with a mounting pin for the battery which has a socket to fit. The entire cartridge battery is rechargeable with eight shots per charge. The wheel holds eight independent capacitor banks and beam emitters that release a laser blast with each pull of the trigger. The revolver is currently priced at $350 for the revolver and one battery cartridge. However, for an additional $15, one can also purchase the charging station made specifically to fit the battery.\n\n     The second generation of the Vega, the MK 2, has a SiAl barrel with better weight distribution, and has universal tactical rail mounts on the top and bottom of the receiver. The rails can be fit with any scope, laser, sight, flashlight, or other modification. This version of the weapon is priced at $380.",

Every observable action and property of nature can be described through interactions between these particles.\n\n     There are four classes of particles; Fermionic Matter, which define Protons (P), Neutrons (N), Electrons (e) and Muons (μ); Etherial Matter, which is charged and Uncharged Qi (q & Q); Supermatter, which is Neutrinos and Aptha; and the raw energy Carrier of the Photon (y).\u0000css\nN: Neutrons, the heaviest neutrally-charged particle. Originally discovered in -8 P.W. during experiments with nuclear fission. They are a primary component in the nuclei of atoms.\n\nP: Protons, the heaviest positively-charged particle. Protons were discovered in -16 P.W. through Atomic Composition Experiments.\n\ne: Electron, the negatively-charged component of an atom. Electrons orbit around the nuclei of atoms, forming a sort of shell which allows atoms to form bonds. Electrons were discovered by most all primitive civilizations in the time between -200 and -10P.W.\n\nμ: Muon, the larger sibling to the Electron. Muons have the same negative charge as an electron, meaning that they can take an electron`s place in the atomic shell. But, since Muons are over two-hundred-times as massive as electrons, meaning that any the shell around a muon-bound atom will be several magnitudes smaller. If two Hydrogen atoms bind together via a shell consisting of a muon, the resulting proximity will eventually result in nuclear fusion. But, a muon currently costs about three times as much energy to create than it produces via fusion.  Muons were discovered in 83 P.W. in fusion experiments on [!1 Bius Tu].\u0000css\nq: Uncharged Qi, the neutral, almost massless variant of the Qi particle. Uncharged Qi does not commonly interact with normal matter, save for scattering through material. Uncharged Qi may have a negligible mass, but it's not massless, meaning it travels at less-than-lightspeed. Uncharged Qi tends to stay within the closed system of a planet's atmosphere. (Though it's also found in solar wind.) The higher the concentration of Qi in an area, the easier Qi-charging reactions can occur.\n\nQ: Charged Qi, is the charged, energy-packed variant of the Qi particle. Charged Qi particles are selectively charged, being able to be positive or negative. The a “half-life” of charged particles changing state is about 8 hours in air, 50 hours in a liquid, and hundreds of years in a solid. Due to this duality, charged Qi can create pseudo-atomic structures that can be applied in many ways. Charged Qi is made by adding energy to Uncharged Qi via certain physical, chemical, and even nuclear reactions. The energy in Charged qi can be applied to make, heat, light, or even motion.\u0000css\nv: Neutrinos are nearly interaction-less particles with negligible mass. They are created in the centers of stars and shoot outward in all directions. Neutrinos pass through normal matter with little interaction.\n\nA: Aptha is a visible, grey particle that interacts with normal matter. Aptha has immense surface tension, meaning that, even on the ground, aptha with gather into a perfect or oblate sphere. Aptha is produced by mixing powdered Qi-conductive materials in a slurry with Tritium Dioxide, and left out in the sun. On the rare occasion a Neutrino from the sun strikes a Neutrino emitted from the decaying Tritium while also in the proximity of a Charged Qi particle, a single Aptha particle is produced out of the two Neutrinos, also discharging the energy in the Qi particle.\u0000css\nY: Photons are the purest form of energy in the known universe. Photons have a sort of wave/particle duality, meaning that they demonstrate properties of both waves and particles. Photons are the prime component of EM radiation, the force that is Visible Light, Radio Waves, Microwaves, and even hazardous Gamma Rays.",

It is situated in the prograde external nadir corner of the [!6 Silver Stream]. \n\n    The economic heart of the nation lies within the home system of the [!7 Tyvant Race] -- [!8 Celesse]. Three planets in the system are colonised: \n        [!2 Kayan] (formerly Nastimye) is the second planet from Cellesse and has a population of 12 Billion.  It is the homeworld of the Tyvant race and the capital of Neo Urra since 102 P.W. after the loss of [!9 Planetary Urra].\n        [!10 Kosh] is the third planet from Celesse.  It was the first planet to be colonised by the Tyvant race since it met the requirements for sustaining [!11 Tyvus life].\n        [!12 Vella] is the moon of Kayan and was the second celestial body colonised by the Tyvant Race in pre-warp times.  The moon counts 5 Billion citizens, and has been Paraterraformed by the gradual development of geodesic domes and pressurized colonies covering much of the surface.  It is the research barycenter of Neo Urra.\u0000css\n    The nation also controls four developing colonies and four frontier worlds.  It is currently trying to colonise the planet of [!13 Netamil] in order to bolster its claim on the strategic system of [!14 Liascus] which holds large, easily-accessible deposits of mercury in its inner asteroid belt and is part of the most common transit [!15 circuit] between [!5 New Tyvantia] and the [!15 GCP]. \n\n    The Neo Urran economy has been under embargo since the creation of the country as it has inherited from the gcp trade embargo inflicted to the Urran Empire after [!16 Karmine Jacob’s] takeover of most of the nation of Tyventia. As a result, it is completely centered inward with the exception of the contraband of ships, weapons and goods.\n\n    For its currency, Neo Urra inherited the Imperial Urran Kar which is approximately worth 0.2 [!17 Itascan Coins] as it was defined in 82.  Because of the [!14 GCP] embargo placed on the nation, this ratio is no longer enforced by the Urran bank and, since the trade volumes are extremely low, the exchange rate remains theoretical.\n\n    Because of its geopolitically isolated situation in the silver stream (Gallea being the only nation Neo Urra maintains warm relations with), the empire is extremely militaristic and fields a first-class voidnavy.  While having some lateness in Computer Science and Ichor manipulation technology, Neo Urra can compensate for it with an edge in laser technology, ship design and lowered cost of manufacturing.\n\n    The state lay claims on all of the territory and claims of the former Urran Empire, its effectively-controlled territory, New Tyventia, [!18 Armalai], Urra and the [!14 Liascus system].",

In the same year, Datec released a version of MoTran with support for modular drivers.\n\n     Drivers for MoTran are made with standardized input-output hooks that allow for better scheduling. These hooks are used by either programs written in [!2 Machina] or [!3 ManuScript].",

The IASO is run by veterans of multiple branches of the Itascan military, and was intended to help veterans become active in their community by assisting them with getting jobs, housing, and transportation.  The IASO reaches out to local businesses and helps staff the businesses with veterans that have skill sets which compliment the position they intend to fill fill.  Unlike private staffing companies, the IASO does not charge the businesses for staffing services. \n\n     The IASO also contacts local mass transit agencies to provide passes for veterans who cannot afford them for a reduced fee, distributing Veteran Passes intended for veterans only.  The IASO also works with local real estate agencies to assist veterans in negotiating reduced pricing for housing\n\n     At the time of its creation, the IASO received 5 million [!1 ITC] from the Itascan government.  However, they were advised that they should consider hosting public events (i.e. barbecues, sports, or movie nights) to raise funds of their own, as they would not be issued another grant from the government.  The IASO has offices in almost every major city, and many large towns on [!2 Itascus].  The IASO also has an office aboard the [!3 Excelsior.] IASO accepts donations from the general public.  Those who submit a donation of $20 [! ITC] or more will receive a handwritten letter from a veteran, thanking the donor for their generosity. \n\n     The IASO prints a monthly magazine for those that have bought the monthly donation package, “The Itascan Serviceman”, as it's called, includes war stories, tips from veterans, battlefield breakdowns, a centerfold with upcoming events at their local IASO office, and the latest in (publicly available) military technology, among other war-related media. The organization follows typical Itascan Conservative values. Their motto is: “By the veterans, For the veterans.”",

Deoria is covered in uniformly textured, light-grey mountain ranges spanning and coiling around the planet along every faultline on the surface. Where there aren`t long mountain ranges, there are deep blue trenches full of liquid water separating the planet`s continents.\n\n     The planet`s surface consists of four notable continents, with a few smaller continental areas nestled between them. The four large continents are Milland, Ricefield, Lumbersweep, and Roothome. The four mega continents are arranged in a sort of spherical tetrahedron, each making contact with the other. \n\n     Deoria is now controlled under a single governmental entity, the [!2 Deorian Government]. In ancient Deorian history (before the year 22), there were three global factions. These factions were Polensend, a nation of 532 Million people inhabiting the Milland continent; the UTR, United Townships of Ricefield, a nation of 685 Million people; and Knollstead, a large nation of 1.26 Billion people inhabiting the continents of Lumbersweep and Roothome. These nations have since unified into the Deoria we know today.\u0000css\n    Deoria's surface is about 30% water and consists of a few continents seperated by seas and mountain ranges.  The most prevalent (habitable) environments on Deoria are forests, plains, mountains (most mountain dwellers live in a region known as Tierra Fría), deserts, and savannas.  These habitats can be classified from one another into three main groups with unique cultures.  Many isolated cultures on Deoria share traits with one another based on the biome/environment they live in, regardless of state, ethnicity, overarching culture, etc.\n    \n    Even though Deoria has its own [!3 local time] system, many Deorian citizens have been observed to use local time and [!4 Galactic Time] interchangeably in daily life. Deoria's Time Table String is \"N-8:00T ZW 1Y/16L/22D/4W/4T/24d/24p\"\n\n    Deoria, as a planet, has notably seen no conflicts with more than 500,000 combatants. The largest conflict on the planet was the [!5 Battle of Jinsed].",

Its build is based off the [!2 Eagle], a previous model built by the [!3 ISA]. Its relative affordability and general usefulness as a transport vehicle are credited as the attributes that made the design so widely used.\n\n     The Harrier has seen most of its use on worlds around [!4 Sol], though it has been spotted in markets elsewhere across Asmodeus; having a notable market presence around [!5 Bius Tu] and [!6 Gallea]. \n\n     The seats that came in the cockpits of earlier models were only designed around F-type bodies, meaning that B-Type pilots were typically very uncomfortable when flying the Harrier.

The likelihood of this causing a failure was 11 in 20. After this point, changes were made to the design to reduce this chance to 3 in 20. \n     57  - Crew seats were changed to universal chairs.\n     62  - Selectively replaced some steel components with equivalents made of aluminum, reducing the weight from 16800kg to 15700.\n     76  - Added elastic coating to the inside of the cabin to ward off some of the effects of [!15 Warp Decay]\n     100 - To celebrate the dawn of a new century, the visual design of the ship was altered slightly. The exterior paint was changed from a solid grey to Titanium White, with grey lines between vertical segments. The fuel tank was also recolored to an orange color.",

Occasionally, they may be equipped with experimental weapons, like the recently announced [!7 RC-1 SMG], or sidearms such as the [!8 Vega]. More recently, the [!9 Bearing 20 .75 caliber Anti-Material Rifle] was included as well. They have a fleet of reconnaissance aircraft complete with thermal imaging cameras, and optical cameras. These recon aircraft are [!10 Neros] modified for stealth. Each team has a [!11 Frigate-class ship] for moving cargo and troops to hotzones, as well as providing orbital bombardment. The ICTU is the top-performing group in unconventional warfare situations, and are some of the most aware, trained soldiers Itascus can offer.",

This is because the primary damage from the weapon comes from the electric discharge of the capacitors in the rounds. While the ends of most Stinger guns host pairs of barbed needles, it's the electric shock that is intended to incapacitate a target.\n\n     Recently, there have been developments in the field of plasma weaponry.

The firing mechanism is spring-loaded by the bolt. The gun can hold three darts loaded through the top. Rounds begin charging once they enter the chamber (if the safety is off). The weapon has an effective range of ~40 meters in 1G.\n\n    The Stinger's darts are electric capacitors. The tails of the darts have fins to keep them straight during flight. The fronts have pairs of needles, each needle connected to a terminal on the capacitor. The needles are made long and sharp, as they're made to be able to pierce through armor. In some variants of the darts, the needles are made with barbs to keep the darts from falling out of their targets. \n\n    Despite the fact that Stingers are made by various manufacturers, darts are usually uniform in their dimensions to allow for better compatibility. The rear fins are 6cm long, 1mm thick, and usually around 1.5 cm wide. The main body of the dart, the capacitor, is 11cm long. The needles at the end of the dart are usually between 2cm and 6cm long. The dart is 1.75cm in radius. The weapon itself costs $225, while darts individually cost $15.\n\nSpecial Information:\n Darts have 18/20 chance to pierce light armor\n Darts do not damage armor\n Darts have a 14/20 chance to ‘kill' electric targets\n Darts stun organic targets for 3-9 seconds",

La'Foy's botanic features are placed in long streaks along the planet's axis of rotation, meaning forests and wetlands are arranged as if claws of unimaginable scale swept across the land.  Geologically, La'Foy is relatively featureless, as its geology is very inactive (compared to most homeworlds).  The planet's bodies of water, from its rivers to its ocean, are long and winding.\n\n    The largest body of water on La'Foy is the Filuke Sea, which is a long, thin, winding ocean which stretches from 34° latitude to 152° latitude.  In fact, the point where the eastern shore meets the equator marks the Longitudinal Origin for this planet in the [!1 STPS] system.\n    The direct west of the Filuke is peppered with large mountain ranges, being a stark contrast to the red flora surrounding them.  These are called the Congmeishu mountains.\n    To the direct east of the Filuke is the Bovo Great Plains.  On the side of the planet opposite of the Filuke (180° longitude) is the Biu'ngan swamps.\n    At around 120° and 240° longitude are the Bingko and Benko forests respectively.\u0000css\n    La'Foy's atmosphere is very humid.  On average, the air of La'Foy is 3% water vapor by volume.  This has the effect of promoting bacterial growth in most all places on the planet.  Because of this humidity, La'Foy is commonly very foggy in most moderate or low-altitude places, with rain being frequent.\n\n    La'Foy's cities are small but numerous, spread very evenly across the surface.  This, combined with the planet's hazy, fogged atmosphere, makes it appear almost sparkly when viewed from the dark side, with lights being dispersed across the surface.  La'Foy's most populous city is [!2 E'Nera], being the planet's only megacity.",

When two crafts are docked, they are able to transfer resources like power and fuel, and sometimes even crew or cargo.  Docking port types are usually non-androgynous, meaning that they have positive (extending) and negative (receiving) variants which can only connect to their opposites.  Space stations and larger craft tend to have an abundance of negative ports, while other ships have positive docking ports for compatibility.  When two spacecraft are docked, each is able to read the other's [!1 Callsign] and other information about one another, given the ports are connected to a computer system.\n\n     Berthing is the act of joining two craft together permanently or semi-permanently.  Berthing ports are much stronger than docking ports, and are considerably more difficult to decouple.  Berthing ports have all the functions of docking ports (resource transfer, crew transfer, etc.).  When berthing ports are connected, they are deadlocked, and meant to be fused or welded together from both the inside and out.  Berthing ports are androgynous and are used in the construction of space stations or larger craft.  Newer berthing ports' interiors consist of removable panels to bridge the two crafts/modules, but older or cheaper ports simply have a section of wall marked to be cut out and removed after berthing.",

Large Berthing Ports are radially locked (at 1/8 rotation intervals) but are androgynous. Large Berthing Ports allow for transfer of fuel, power, computer system networking, and usually crew/cargo.

Extra Large Berthing ports are used in the construction of large space-fairing structures such as [!1 Space Stations] and very large craft. XL Berthing Ports use electromagnets to better align and couple with one another. Positive XL Berthing Port nodes use positively-charged magnets, and negative nodes use negatively-charged magnets.

Type-A docking ports are capable of transferring power, fuel, computer networking, and of course, cargo and crew. All variations of Type-A docking ports are 60cm in diameter, and most are non-androgynous. When two Type-A ports are connected, the space between them (within the lips) becomes a buffer zone. Because the all variants' port doors open inward, they will not be able to open if there is significantly lower pressure in the buffer zone. The pressure is equalized using an air valve in the door.\n\n     There are three common variations of Type-A ports:\n          Type-A+, pronounced “Type ‘A' Plus”, or, “Type ‘A' Positive”, is the positive connector variant. Type-A+ docking ports have long probes leading the rim of the docking port, extending 23cm out from the lip. The probe is not integral to docking, it's simply used to assist with alignment. Type-A+ docking ports are able to dock with Type-A- docking ports and are usually found on general spacecraft.\n\n          Type-A-, pronounced “Type ‘A' Minus”, or, “Type ‘A' Negative”, is the negative connector variant. Type-A- docking ports have an inlet for a probe of a Type-A+ docking port in the center. The lip of this inlet extends about 2cm out from the lip of the docking port itself. This is to aid with alignment. Type-A- docking ports are able to dock with Type-A+ and Type-A* docking ports. They are found on [!1 carrier] or [!2 station-class] structures for smaller craft to dock to them.\n\n          Type-A*, pronounced “Type ‘A' Star”, is a special connector variant. The area inside of the lip of the docking port is featureless, sometimes with a viewing port. Type-A* docking ports are designed to be able to dock with Type-A- ports, as well as other Type-A* ports. They were introduced in the year 74 in order to \"make spacecraft docking more universal.\"",

While the core tenets of Disterrestrialism are thought to have originated from somewhere else in the galaxy, there are a large number of Disterrestrial communes having stemmed from GCP worlds. Currently, in the GCP, there are four standing communes with over 10,000 members. Ranked from largest to smallest, they're The Order of Exodus, with ~36,000 members; The Order of Paladins, with ~19,000 members; The Order of Scholars, with ~9,000 members; and The Order of Shipwrights, with ~2,800 members.\n\n     Members of this religion collect in communes or groups of communes called orders. The individual communes within an order are called \"sects\", \"abbeys\", or other names, while the lead commune in an order is called a \"convent\", \"monastery\", \"temple\", or another name based on the branch of Disterrestrialism. Due to their nature, these communes are unable to make all of the resources they require. So, each commune has a trade it masters in order to generate revenue, which is then used to purchase resources they cannot generate themselves.\n\n     The core belief of any branch of Disterrestrialism is some variation of the following: \"Life emerged from the cradling comfort of a planet, giving us the warmth and nutrients to expand and grow. But just as we were destined to leave the obscure depths of our oceans, we are destined to leave the cradles of our atmospheres in pursuit of growth and enlightenment in every species.” Disterrestrialist orders are very rigidly structured and well-organized. To maximize their productivity, they attempt to plan out every aspect of their schedules. This applies to both large-scale projects (such as constructing a ship), and small-scale timeframes (such as daily schedules). Each disterrestrialist in a commune has amounts of time allotted for work, meals, leisure, and sleep in each day.",

These latches can only be disengaged by the port's control unit.\n\n     A type-C docking port has a set of double doors that opens inwardly, like a book. The hatch is unlocked by pulling a lever from the inside, but, thanks to their design, they are unable (very difficult) to open when there is significantly higher pressure on the inside of the craft than the outside (i.e., if an operator tries to open the port from within the pressurized cabin while the craft is in a vacuum). Type-C docking ports usually have small glass viewports on one or both of the doors.\n\n     When two craft are docked using type-c ports, the space between the ports acts as a buffer zone. The buffer zone is within the lips of the docking ports. Initially, the buffer zone is a vacuum. The buffer zone can be filled with air using a valve on the door of the port. Once the buffer zone is adequately pressurized (indicating that the seal is airtight, and therefore safe), the port doors can be opened.\n\n      Type-C docking ports were designed and implemented in 53 by the [!1 ISA].

The ring spins around its axis of rotation when powered. When spinning, the ring and everything in it is subject to an outward centripetal force. This force is an adequate substitute for natural gravity, being able to replicate the same strength and properties.\n\n     The torus of a gravity ring is connected to its center by two or more ‘spokes'. One or two of these spokes is a tunnel passage from a zero-g section of the station to the nonzero-g ring. Gravity rings can be anywhere from 15m to 300m+ in radius, with smaller radii requiring shorter periods of rotation to achieve the same outward acceleration. Due to walking crew, moving cargo, or other redistributions of mass, the COM (Center Of Mass) of the gravity ring may shift away from its axis of rotation. This may cause the structure to wobble or shake, which is very dangerous. To prevent this, modern gravity rings are built with special plumbing systems on the outermost portion of the ring to automatically distribute liquids and align the center of mass with the axis of rotation.\n\n     Gravity rings can be used in place of [!2 Exercise modules], as the constant application of a gravity-like force is an adequate method of mitigating the effects of microgravity atrophy. Though, this is not a cost-effective alternative, as gravity rings can cost many magnitudes more than exercise modules.",

These crates were marketed to distributors and shipping companies that had a need for keeping cargo cool, but also a desire to use new crates that complied with shipping standards.\n\n   Most refrigerator crates are operated by a small panel next to the hazard square. These panels tend to consist of only a few buttons to adjust temperature and/or to toggle the unit's power. To maximize the amount of cargo per expensive cooling unit, refrigerated shipping crates are usually quite large, with some being over two meters in length and a meter tall.\n\n   Initially, refrigerated shipping crates were battery-powered. Though, as replacing batteries was starting be be seen as a waste of labor, and as powered shipping rails became more popular, battery-powered units were phased out in favor of rail-powered variants.",

They are commonly found incorperated in ship designs made for extended stays in space.\n\n     Kitchenette modules come in various dimentions, and with various amenities. Commonly, kitchenette modules are made with a microwave oven, refridgerator, press-fryer, rehydration gun, micro-g wash basin, and [!1 micro-g dining table].\n\n     The microwave ovens found in these kitchenette are not unlike terrestrial microwaves. The notable difference is, instead of having a rotating platter, these microwaves have a rotating serrated skewer in the middle which cooks are intended to place food items over.\n\n     The refrigerators in these modules are very similar to terrestrial refrigerators, thouogh full of pockets, pouches, and boxes instead of shelves and trays.\n\n     A press-fryer is a cooking appliance used for frying and grilling food in microgravity. The appliance consists of a heated baseplate, four rods with fasteners, and a (sometimes also heated) top plate. The four rods are connected perpendicular to each corner of the baseplate. The top plate is aligned by the four rods and kept in place by the fasteners. When in use, press-fryers are usually draped with a mesh veil to keep most grease particles expelled by the food from floating freely in the cabin.\n\n     A rehydration gun is a simple tool. It is a small device consisting of a button, tube, and needle. When connected to a water outlet, it is stabbed into packs of dehydrated food to rehydrate it.\n\n     Micro-g wash basins are long, semi-enclosed spaces used for washing food or other things. The top of a wash basin holds a low-pressure water nozzle that emits water when objects are held near them. The bottom of the wash basin, which is a water receptacle, generates negative air pressure to keep water droplets from leaving the basin.",

Ridges of rock pierce through the ice and snow, only clues to the valleys formed by the heavy ice between them. The rocky ridges are the black outcrop of rocks seen from space, aligned with ancient mountains. There are a few areas where the crust still allows for magma to come up from the mantle. These volcanoes were called ‘the warmth' by ancient Galleats. The volcanoes only last for about 5 years before the plates they sat under would shift, fostering ecosystems around them seen nowhere else. Today, the surface is still white and icy. However, most ridges are inhabited by massive cities that extend out to the ice.\u0000css\n\n     Most plant life is hardy and dark to soak up as much sunlight as it can, having evolved to survive off minimal light, and tends to have abilities to store heat from the sun to keep their cell walls from disintegrating into ice crystals. The life, when DNA sequenced, shows that Gallean life was once more tropical and lush, supporting a leading theory that the planet was once closer to its sun Gavia, or the star itself has since become dimmer. It is accepted that the ancestors of the Galleat race were evolving during this time. As the sun drifted further and further, life had to adapt. Notably, many companies that offer cloud computing services are based on Gallea, commonly using Gallea's naturally frigid atmosphere for cheap cooling of components.",

Specifically, the craft was designed by the fledgling [!3 Eriian] government in the year 42.  As the concept of interplanetary civilization developed in the Sol System, so did a need for interplanetary trade on Erii.  The cargo volume of the [!3 Pelican], ~28m^3, had been a bottleneck in shipping resources from, and valuables to [!4 Itascus].  This lead to the design of the Walrus, by admission of its designer, becoming \"more or less just a long Pelican\".  Due to the expected weight of added cargo, the Walrus's design has omitted hardware related to takeoff, atmospheric flight, or landing.  While this reduces the craft's dry mass, it renders it incapable of landing on the surface of a planet.  The Walrus is used primarily for transportation of cargo between [!5 Space Stations].\n\n     Due to its nomadic appeal, never needing (or being able to) make home on a planet, Walrus-model ships have spread across the [!6 GCP],  following the proverbial trade winds.  Though, Walruses are still constructed foremost on the stations [!7 Excelsior] and [!8 Skypier]. \n\n     Since the Walrus was designed to go through lengthy periods of rushing through empty space with relatively large crews, it was designed with a [!9 Kitchenette Module].\u0000css\nComponent breakdown (Top to bottom):\n Component Name                         Manufacturer Mass   Diameter Height  \n [!10 Type A Docking Port]              (Various)    50kg     80cm    20cm    \n 3-Seat compact cockpit                 [!11 ISA]    3200kg   3.5m    2.8m   \n Lavatory                               [!12 IAC]    320kg    3.5m    60cm\n [!13 Kitchenette Module]               (Various)    1200kg   3.5m    2.2m\n Interior Air-Tight Divider Hatch       (Various)    120kg    (1m*2m rect.)\n Large Cargo Bay                        (Various)    1300kg   3.5m    8.2m\n ├Exterior Pressure Valve               (Various)    5kg      2cm     4cm\n ├Interior [!14 Cargo Rails]            (Various)    120kg    ~~~~    ~~~~\n └Exterior [!15 Type-C Docking Port]    (Various)    75kg     1.3m    20cm\n Inline Service Bay                     (Various)    200kg    3.5m    35cm\n ├10L Waste Storage Tank                (Various)    40kg     ~~~~    ~~~~\n ├Tri-Planar Reaction Wheels            [!16 IHMC]   160kg    ~~~~    ~~~~\n ├Life Support Cabinet                  ISA          40kg     ~~~~    ~~~~\n │├CO2 Scrubber                         ISA          70kg     ~~~~    ~~~~\n │├[!17 ArC] System (uses radiators)    (Various)    55kg     ~~~~    ~~~~\n │├[!18 MoTran] Life Support Controller [!19 Datec]  1kg      ~~~~    ~~~~\n │└Dehumidifyer                         (Various)    20kg     ~~~~    ~~~~\n └4x 50L Lqd.

When viewed from space, it appears as a varied iceball, with many salt oceans still existing on the surface without having frozen due to the salt lowering the freezing point. Icebergs the size of islands can be seen floating in the open ocean, while thin ice over the rest of the ocean surface leaves a distinct look from space. \n\n     Just inside the goldilocks zone of it's small star, the planet has cooled to near total freezing. It's massive salt deposits has allowed portions of it's seas from it's geologically ‘warm'  period to still show through the frost. In an astronomical timescale, its cooling was very recent, only happening within the last million years. Much of the surface is still quite rocky, harboring fewer glaciers than other [!2 Gallean] planets. The permafrost is thin across the planet's equatorial regions, due to the salt within the soil, lowering the freezing point.\n\n     Only relatively recently has the planet started its colonization, having begun in the year 46. It has the smallest population out of any other planet in the Gallean nation. The new terrain has proved strange and fascinating to Gallean colonists. With only 50 years of colonization thus far, the planet has only a few cities, with most of them being small settlements 10,000 residents at most. Though, unlike the typical cities,  the capital city of the planet, Zerania City, has 1.5 million permanent inhabitants. Zerania City holds a substantial amount of political control over the rest of the settlements, and therefore most of the planet.",

        "data": "css\n    The Skyrail is a type of transit system used as public transportation within large cities.  A Skyrail system is a fleet of autonomus and/or manually-driven railcars.  These railcars hang vertically from pairs of rails at least six meters off of the ground.  The rails these cars connect to span vast networks that cover entire inner cities.  The railcars can move up to 50 kilometers per hour (13 meters per second), and combined with their low risk of traffic delays, it makes them a prime choice for commuters desiring to get to somewhere in their city very quickly.\n\n    There are two common types of railcars in Skyrail systems, Personal Cars and Commuter Cars.\n    Personal Cars can be summoned at terminals by individuals, and commonly only have four seats.  Upon boarding a Personal Car, its passenger(s) interact with a computer onboard to select a Skyrail terminal in their city that they would like to be delivered to.  Personal Cars commonly directly cost money, or an intermediate currency made specifically for the system (ex: Skyrail tokens).  This is to offset the cost of maintaining the system.  Personal Cars, which are smaller, are connected to their rails above by one connector.\n    Commuter Cars are much larger boxcars, and can seat anywhere between sixteen to fourty people.  Commuter Cars usually follow schedules and routes, as opposed to going to a specified location on request.  This makes them more like city busses than a taxi service.  These cars, which are larger than others, are connected to their rails by (at least) two connectors.\n\n    Unlike [!1 trains], Skyrail cabs are able to easily start or stop on command as well as change rails for turning. This gives them the manuverability of a [!2 city bus] while avoiding the traffic of city streets.\u0000css\n    The physical rail networks usually hang over inner city roads and streets.  Because of this, Skyrail rail networks tend to match road networks within a city (though less-traveled roads are typically omitted).  Rails tend to hang over the exact middle of roads (or in the middle of lanes, if there are multiple rails over the same road).  The rails themselves are suspended by supports connected to the ground, or to the sides of structurally-sound buildings.  Skyrail terminals are elevated metal platforms resembling wide catwalks, or small plazas built into the sides of buildings.  Depending on the terminal's size, it may have benches for waiting passengers, restrooms, or other ammenities.  If a terminal is intended to be a node for Personal Cars, it will have a machine of some sort to accept payment (or Skyrail tokens) and summon a Skyrail cab.\n\n    Skyrail was first designed in the year 61 by the [!3 Trametro] company, which has maintained the system's design, applications, and implementations ever since.  The first Skyrail system with implemented in [!4 Liveston City] on [!5 planet Osirja], which quickly became a popular mode of transport.",

This section is only for ships that are able to control their landing, so that they can land in a specific lot. For some rocket fields with heavy traffic, specific lots may be premium. These premium lots are actually hydraulic pads, capable of lowering the craft into the ground. The craft is then covered from above by a large hatch (or sometimes a tarp) to keep it safe from a planet's weather.\n\n     The second section, referred to as \"the field\", is a much larger area, usually upwards of dozens of square kilometers. This section is commonly just open plains of soil or light fauna to act as a cheap cushioning for craft without landing gear (such as [!2 drop pods]). The craft is then moved either to a lot or into an on-site hangar.",

If there are more active scripts than a machine has cores, the system will start scheduling all script threads to be divided up among the cores leading to a dramatic slowdown in performance.\n\n   The mother processor of the machine is relegated to running the operating system itself, managing the slave processors under it. But, the system allowed for certain programs written in [!4 Machina] to be run on the mother processor, functionally soft-patching them to the kernel. These kernel patches could add, or re-write core system functions, and files for these programs were given the \".KXEC\" file extension. A common type kernel program was a process that could output system information graphically. Graphical User Interfaces for MoTran have prooved very useful in using the operating system.",

MoTran 3 is a direct upgrade from MoTran 2, being largely the same system architecture. Almost all drivers made for MoTran 2 are compatible with Version 3; MoTran 3 was intended to be backwards-compatible by design.\n\n   Using the new GUI, MoTran 3 allows for deeper control over hardware processes, as well as allowing for more detailed debugging of drivers and [!1 ManuScript] processes. MoTran 3 was programmed for better allocation of system resources, meaning that MoTran will no longer suffer from dramatic slowdowns when the number of software threads exceeds the number of [!2 slave cores] in the machine.\n\n   Like MoTran 2, MoTran 3 allows for the kernel to be soft-patched with programs written in [!3 Machina]. These kernel programs still use the extension \".KXEC\".\n\n   MoTran 3 is one of the most widely-used operating systems in the known galaxy, being used in aircraft, lathes, mills, spacecraft, general terrestrial craft, [!4 warp drive] controllers, and even [!5 power armor].",

Each slave processor is paired with a [!1 memory] chip of any size.  This memory chip is exclusive to that slave processor and is called a \"cache\".  Together, the slave processor and memory chip make something called a 'core'.  Every slave processor core is controlled and directed by the 'mother processor'.  The mother processor is the only processor within a parallel architecture machine with hardware privileges.  Therefore, any program running on a slave core must negotiate with the code on the mother processor for hardware access.  This, along with the fact that a program running on one core cannot easily access the data of another, is why the parallel computer architecture is considered the most secure modern architecture.\u0000css\n    The number of cores a machine has determines the number of threads it can compute at once.  The mother processor is able to stop/start any core (meaning any program thread) at any time.  The mother processor also has complete control over the memory within each core, being able to change the program or data within each core during runtime with no restrictions.  The mother processor also determines what sections of Main Memory a core is allowed to access.\n\n    The memory in each core is (usually) limited to 64KiB and consists of [!2 Electric Memory], which is very fast. Main Memory, a special, larger section of memory separate from the cores, can be up to 4GiB (or more) in size and is controlled by the Mother Processor.  Though, despite this, Main Memory is much slower than core memory because it is usually made of [!3 Qi Memory].  A slave core attempting to run code directly from Main Memory will slow to a crawl due to the slower memory speeds.  This is why the amount of fast memory in a core determines what threads it can (effectively) process, as every program requires a certain amount of memory to be run.",

The word is derived from the word \"Entropy\", a measure of disorder and distribution of energy in a system, and the suffix \"-ism\", denoting a belief in or following of something. A common belief in this religion is that one is able to use entropy to gain insights about the world around them that they wouldn't be able to with normal means.\n\n    Entropism is popular belief in [!1 La'Foy], being followed by 68% of the population; and [!2 Ghillymede], being followed by 59% of the population.  It also has a small following in the nations [!3 Armalai] and the [!4 Solar Union], with less than 10% of the population identifying as Entropist.\n\n    The detail that classifies Entropism as a theistic religion is the belief that the universe itself is, or has a consciousness. This consciousness has free will, and with this free will, it exerts changes and forces in particles of matter. Individually, these changes to particles are too small to be measured with any physical tools. Together, the forces on each particle add up to move fluid matter, such as minutely effecting the flow of water, or creating a draft in the air. While these changes can be measured, the contributing forces are small enough that they can be dismissed as nothing more than the random movement of particles.\u0000css\n    Entropism, or belief systems resembling it, have been recorded to have started independently in many places throughout the galaxy. Though, its deepest developments root back to the planet [!4 La'Foy], where the major tenets of the religion were thought to have developed. Entropism, as we know it today, was properly developed in the -30s, solidifying the common beliefs of the religion.\n\n    Devoted Entropists gather weekly on a weekday of their choosing. They gather in buildings, or just specified areas, called Totem Houses. Entropists believe that, when trying to communicate with the universe, that greater numbers means greater power in the same manner that larger numbers of people can produce a louder voice. In these gatherings, the Entropists decide on something they desire the Universe to influence, something that requires a large change.  They then pray to the Universe together to try to convince it to enact their desired changes. After prayer, the gathering typically either leaves, or they stay for other social activities.\n\n    Some devoted followers of Entropism claim that their connection with the Universe's consciousness is so strong, that the Universe is able to directly manipulate the chemistry and synapses of their brain. This, allegedly, gives the person the ability to listen to, or even directly communicate with the Universe. These people are either referred to as \"Prophets\", or \"Lunatics\" based on their popularity.\n    \n    Though Entropism has received criticism from realist and secular groups for having no base in real physics, many of the core beliefs of the system are un-disprovable. For example, the claim that the Universe acts with forces too small to be measured is, by definition, un-disprovable, due to the fact that no real-world tools would be able to gather evidence against the claim.",

        "data": "css\n    While, like most religions, Entropism varies across the galaxy, there are a few notable common traits.\n\n    Transmission Pendulum:\n        A Transmission Pendulum it a tool used to communicate with the Universe. The common name for a Transmission Pendulum is a \"Hand Totem\", or they are just informally referred to as a \"Totem\". These pendulums are long fins arranged in an 'X' shape with two pairs of fins perpendicular to each other, or a 'Y' shape with three fins placed 120° apart. The 'X' arrangement is the more popular of the two in most Entropist communities. Though, notably, on [!1 Armalai] and [!2 Ganeimede], Entropists almost exclusively carry 'Y' shaped Transmission Pendulums. The fins, typically made of a light metal, are attached to a long chain, string, or other cable. While the lengths of the fins and cable can vary, the total length is usually around 30cm. A person uses a Transmission Pendulum by looping the string around their finger (or equivalent limb) and letting the pendulum hang at least 40cm away from their body. Once the pendulum has stopped swaying from the user's moving it into place, they then attempt to talk to the Universe's consciousness. They ask the Universe a question or make a request of it. Whether this communication is verbal or not is irrelevant; most Entropists believe that spoken language, thoughts, and the air disturbed by the pendulum are equally understandable to the Universe. While making their request, an Entropist will lightly sway the pendulum. This act is thought to embed the user's wishes into the disorder of the matter around them. Once they are done with this part of the prayer, they stop the motion of the pendulum. They then wait for a response based on the movement of the pendulum due to the currents of the air and/or the small, random movements of their bodies. The pendulum can give one of four responses: Swaying towards the user, swaying parallel to the user, swaying circularly, or remaining still.\u0000css\n    Totems and Totem Houses:\n        A Totem House is a place of religious gathering for Entropists. They are large buildings or outdoor structures that seat at least 10 people. The centerpiece of any Totem House is a massive transmission pendulum called a Totem. These Totems are many times larger than a handheld transmission pendulum, being upwards of two meters long. Totems are affixed by a rope or chain to a pulley on the ceiling. The room/space that the Totem hangs in is called the Glade. Using the rope and pulley, the congregation gather to pull and release the rope in order to cause the totem to swing. Glades are shaped like tall domes, sometimes even being described as \"egg-shaped\". Glades are very open spaces; very enclosed glades have just two large windows which allow the Totem to swing through them without striking the walls, while very open glades are constructed out of just a few arches to allow the Totem more freedom of movement. Glades are also open to allow airflow from outside to exert force on the Totem, so that the congregation may interpret communications from the Universe from its motion.\n        \n    Diffusion Watching:\n        Traditionally called \"Tear Shattering\", Diffusion Watching is the act of taking a clear fluid (clean water) and dripping one, or multiple drops of a dye or other visible fluid into it. By watching the seemingly random patterns in which the drop diffuses into the fluid, one could use it as a suitable, detectable type of entropy to interpret a response from the Universe after a prayer. In the past, Tear Shattering was seen by some as a method of congregated prayer. A congregation of Entropists would gather at the edge of a body of water before pouring cups, buckets, or barrels of dye into the water. This practice is rare in the modern era, as most districts on civilized planets treat the act as needless pollution, and most Entropists still believe a Totem is more appropriate for group prayer.",

        "data": "css\n    Local Time is timekeeping method based on the physical attributes of the body on which the Local Time is used. Initially, the units used within a local time system were completely different from those of another. As [!1 Unil] was spread and popularized across the known galaxy, the names for these units of time were standardized, even though they were still of different lengths. The common names for these units (in order of size) are as follows:\n    Year     - (Y) The orbital period of the local body\n    Season   - (S) A large fraction of a year, usually defined by changes in climate\n    Lunen    - (L) A fraction of a Season or Year, typically based on the orbital period of a natural satellite\n    Period   - (P) An uncommon subdivision of a Lunen\n    Sol      - (S) The rotational period of the local body, usually an even fraction of a Lunen\n    Meridian - (M) Almost exclusively one half of a Sol, though sometimes one third or fourth \n    Watch    - (W) Commonly a large fraction of a Sol\n    Tone     - (T) Commonly a small fraction of a Day or a large fraction of a Watch\n    Dash     - (d) Commonly a fraction of a Tone in any size\n    Point    - (p) The smallest unit that sees common use, a fraction of a Tone\n    Moment   - (m) A rare unit name used if the local time system in question uses a unit of time smaller than a Point\u0000css\n    To efficiently describe the local time system of a planet, many people write what is called a \"Time Table String\" to describe the units a local time system uses, as well as the proportions. Take the Time Table String \"1Y/2S/4L/24S/4W/6T/4d/36p\" for example. In it, it describes on year as being made up of two seasons, each season being made up of 4 Lunens, each Lunen being made up of 24 Sols, and so on. And using the period of the planet's rotation or orbit, one could do simple division or multiplication to solve for the exact measurements of each unit in the string. In the event that a planet's time system does not use a common name for a unit of time, the name for the unit is written out in full as opposed to using a common unit's abbreviation.\n\n    Some planets make use of a \"Floating Chronal Reference\". Having a Floating Chronal Reference means that, for an observer on the surface of a world, the current time within a day is not constant across the planet. Instead, it is based on the planet's sun's position within the sky (or more accurately, the longitude of the observer). Commonly on these planets, the local time of sol is determined by sunrise, local noon, or even sunset. For example, on [!2 planetary Itascus], the local Tone of Day is determined by time of local noon; 10-o-clock (Halfway through the sol) is defined as when the sun is in the middle of its arc across the sky.\u0000css\n    Planets with Floating Chronal Reference almost exclusively use a Time Zone system. In a Time Zone system, the planet is divided up longitudinally into equally-sized slices called Time Zones. Time Zones are used for large units of time that are less than a sol, such as Meridians, Watches, or Tones. The number of time zones on a world is determined by the number of units that the zones are divided by within a sol. For example, if the Timezones on a planet are based on Watches, and there are six watches in a local sol, the planet will have six Timezones. Time is the same everywhere within a Timezone, with each zone's time being determined based on its longitude. To represent Floating Chronal References and Timezones in a Time Table String, the string is prefixed with the following: the event that determines the time of day, sunrise ('R'), noon ('N'), or sunset ('S'); what time of day that this event determines (as well as the unit); and a character describing if the planet uses Timezones ('Z') (followed by the unit the timezones are measured in), or the time is absolute ('A') based purely on an observer's longitude. So, for example, planetary Itascus's string is \"N-10:00T ZT 1Y/12L/18D/20T/40d\", because the Floating Chronal Reference is based on local noon, and local noon is defined as 10-o-clock in Tones, and the planet makes use of Timezones that are divided by the number of Tones in a sol.",

Around this time, two popular political positions developed, Hierarchism  and Late Industrialism. Hierarchism was strongly aligned with the ideology of capitalism as well as minor ideologies of small government. Hierarchism was backed by the leaderships of states and nations that descended from the tribes. Late Industrialism was more aligned with the standard ideals of socialism and a larger government. Late Industrialism was backed primarily by members that identified as Gallea's working class, who felt like their tribes and governments weren't meant just to help people from the outside, but financially in the inside as well. Though they still didn't believe in full government control. \n\n    By the year -53, the population had reached 1.2 billion and political tensions soon arose between the tribes and nations of the planet; the rising popularity of the planet's two main political parties instilled an “us versus them” mentality into many residents of the world. Within a decade, the scattered tribes and micronations banded together as they saw foreign ideologies as more and more of a threat to their own ways of life. The majority of the townships and tribes governed by a Republic system banded together into a federacy we call the SDD (Strategic Democratic Defense). The other townships and kingdoms, primarily with monarchical or autocratic rule, formed into two major factions. These factions were the RGU (Royal Gallean Union), which functioned less as an alliance and more a union into a single state ruled by Monarch democracy, and the GSA (Gallean Sovereigns Alliance), which was structured as a confederation. The SDD was strictly Late Industrialist by popular ideology, that being the trait that brought them together.-\u0000css\nThe GSA was fervently Hierarchist in direct opposition to the SDD, while the RGU was presenting itself as more centrist, while still leaning towards political Hierarchism. These names were translated from native Gallean into [!2 Unil].\n\n    Within a [!3 planetary year] of their formation, the GSA and SDD declared each other political enemies and general adversaries. The diplomatic tensions between GSA and SDD quickly boiled over, spurring a surprise invasion from the GSA into SDD territories with the intention of destroying the commoner governments. This marked the beginning of the Gallean World War, simply called the “War of Two Nations”. \n\n    The RGU kept itself neutral for three years while the war went on around them. That was, until the [!4 Skirmish of Shells]. This brought the RGU into the world war, changing the conflict's common name to “The Trio's War”. The 3-way war would end up killing 285 million Galleats, devastating cities across the globe. Throughout the seemingly endless bloodshed, the world's workforce was aligning more and more with the ideas of Industrialism, regardless of the proclaimed ideologies of their nations. The RGU was the first to convert to Late Industrialism, due to internal political pressure in -47. The RGU and SSD made an impromptu alliance in response to the change in political ties. The SSD shared a new technology with the RGU; a technology for higher definition, secure radio transmission. Working together, the RGU and SSD warred the GSA into submission by -46, ending the Gallean World War.",

The conflict between the two factions started on 4/8/-50, formally starting the skirmish. To keep their border from being invaded, the RGU military sent an infantry battalion to construct fortifications within their territory. The RGU infantry gathered in an abandoned mining village in the hills which they fortified and turned into a defensive position.\n\n     Both the GSA and SSD's scouts noticed the RGU's fortified hill position. Since neither party was aware of the RGU's presence, they both independently assumed it belonged to the other side, regardless of the position's distance from the main conflict. On the third [!2 galactic day] of the conflict, the hill base was bombarded by heavy artillery from both the GSA and the SDD. The leadership of the base declared it a direct attack, and communicated with the RGU military headquarters. The RGU military leaders began mobilizing more troops, and instructed the base to eliminate the enemy artillery.\u0000css\n     While the RGU's hill fort was being bombarded many times an hour, 1,500 of the RGU soldiers in the camp marched for three hours to go around the front lines of the main conflict and flank the GSA artillery, which was set up far from the trenches and hills. The surprise attack was a success, eliminating all three of the GSA's heavy artillery units as well as all the operators and the infantry escort. The surprise attack only wounded 32 RGU soldiers, and only killed 22. \n\n     The GSA infantry on the front lines, informed of the attack by radio before the position was destroyed, reasoned that they were routed by SSD attackers, and decided to retreat by a few kilometers. Since the small RGU force was returning to base after the surprise attack, they encountered many large companies of retreating GSA soldiers. This was the biggest cause of RGU casualties in the conflict, as they only returned to base with about 600 out of the 1,500 soldiers that left to strike the artillery.\n\n     In conclusion, this battle caused the GSA to lose a few kilometers of territory to the SSD as the front line advanced towards them. The RGU also formally entered the [!3 Gallean World War].",

        "data": "css\n    As [!1 Ganeimede] appeared to be losing the [!2 Ganeimedic Rebelion], the Ganeimedic leadership was willing to try any idea to turn the tide of the crisis. They decided that the need to look for help from somewhere. And it couldn't be from [!3 Itascus] or [!4 Gallea]. They decided that their best course of action would be to get the public on their side. And so, they recorded an audio message, one that was meant for the world's ears. \n\n    The message they recorded was a plea for help. In proper [!5 Unil], the message was the following: “We, the people of Ganeimede, are but a small, lunar mining colony. Our only desire was the right to control the sale of the valuable materials that we mine ourselves, from our own planet. And for this, we are being invaded by foriegn powers. This is an affront to our autonomy, and even an affront to the very idea of a free cosmos. If this can be allowed to happen, what kind of example does this set for the future? If you can hear us, please, heed our plea; otherwise, we might not be heard for much longer.”\u0000css\n    The colony had no internet access, so it couldn't be uploaded. Broadcasting the message wouldn't reach beyond the invading Itacan army or the hemisphere of Gallea facing them. And it wasn't unreasonable to assume that attempting to send a ship with a copy of the message would only result in it being shot down. So, Ganeimedic leadership contacted their single warp-capable freighter in orbit. This freighter hadn't moved since the arrival of the Itascan occupation force. The freighter was contacted and given special instructions; the crew of two was, after receiving a copy of the message, to warp out of the [!6 Gavia] system and head to [!7 Deoria] and [!8 Bius Tu], sending copies of the message to news outlets on both worlds. After they were briefed, the crew were securely transmitted a copy. The copy was saved to a cassette tape. The Itascan occupation detected the craft warping away as they left with the message, but they were under the impression that the ship was still aligned with Gallea.\n\n    The messenger ship stopped near Bius Tu and promptly entered a stable orbit. They then docked with the [!9 Gazer] station. The crew of two entered the station to tell Ganeimede's side of the occupation. News of the Itascan occupation had already spread over the internet, but details were unclear. By chance, the leader of the Tuine nation, Bius Tu himself, was on Gazer for diplomatic reasons. The two messengers promptly requested an audience with the Tuine leader. After explaining who they were, they were allowed to briefly speak with Bius Tu. They played him their copy of the plea, and virtually begged for assistance. After a brief discussion, the Tuine leader told the messengers that their plea would be considered, and they were dismissed. The message was picked up by popular Tuine news organizations, and happened to gain more social traction among the Tuine populus compared to that of Deoria, being picked up by more mainstream media outlets on the planet.\u0000css\n    The freighter warped into Deoria's SOI and burned into a low, stable orbit. The craft then rendezvoused with [!10 The Nexus] and docked with it. After giving a copy of the message to anyone who would listen, they bartered for some supplies. They left within four hours of docking, cautious that Itascan warp-capable ships might have been looking for them. They warped away, heading for planet Bius Tu. The message, along with the story it related to, was quickly picked up by minor news outlets, but was largely dismissed by larger news corporations. The story gained some attention with the Deorian populous, and there was a small social push for government action to help the Ganeimedic miners. But this was challenged by a popular counter argument that it was not in national Deoria's best interest to sour relations with Gallea, or more importantly, Itascus, by assisting a small colony on a distant moon.\n\n    The crew of two, now that the message had been adequately delivered, decided that their directive had been fulfilled. Without instruction for what they should do after the mission, they considered what they should do next. They reasoned that returning to the Gavia system would mean the destruction of their craft upon detection, so they decided not to return home, at least not yet. Instead, they traded the last of the Helium-3 onboard their freighter for a sizable amount of food, water, and Hydrogen fuel. They then warped into local interplanetary space, and went radio silent.\n\n    Copies of the message spread from Deoria and Bius Tu across the fledgling internet. Notably, it eventually reached the Itascan and [!11 Ghillian] populations. The spread of the message to these locations is credited as being essential to the outcome of the Ganeimedic Rebellion.",

        "data": "css\n    As the [!1 Gallean government] started planning to colonize the planet [!2 Zerania], it became obvious that they would need many more warp-capable ships in order to reasonably bring enough resources to the planet to colonize it. Determined to stop relying on [!3 Itascus] for warp-drive materials, they began establishing mining sites on their moon, [!4 Ganeimede] in the year 42, collecting Helium-3 for use in making [!5 warp cores]. However, the project proved to be costly. Over time, the mining sites evolved into mining colonies, accidentally becoming a fully-colonized planet under Gallean control. \n\n    Under the weight of the new space logistics program to move Helium-3 and other resources, as well as the standard social welfare it was already paying to the miners, the program was having trouble financially. The wages of the miners became mismanaged, and eventually they were quietly lowered to ease the stress on the system. The lunar colonies expressed their discontent, but the government stated that there was nothing that could be done at the time. Many Ganeimedic miners expressed a desire to go on strike, but realized it would be logistical suicide; at that time, Ganeimede had no method of producing food or other essential products, so its citizens were reliant on their homeworld for their survival.\u0000css\n    Over the course of the next five years, the colony kept working to produce the Helium-3 that was being sent to Gallea for processing. All the while, they were improving their own infrastructure; they built indoor farms (as Ganeimede barely has an atmosphere to support plant life), water reclaimers, subsurface mines, metal foundries, oxygen generators, and every other essential machine for life on a planet. This also stimulated Ganeimede's internal economy. And, even though the Ganeimedic colonists were vocal about their discontent, their gripes were mostly silenced by the Gallean government back home, so new colonists were still arriving. In fact, the number of arriving colonists increased as new industry jobs were opening up. By the end of the five-year period, the population of the moon went from just under 2,000, to approximately 16,000. The planet kept its near unanimous, resentful attitude towards its homeworld, but since their collective voice was getting quieter over time and there was nothing they could really do, the attitude was ignored by the homeworld government.\n\n    In the year 47, the moon finally had all the systems in place that it needed to be self-sustaining. The mistreated workers could finally make a statement. They sent a formal message to the leaders of the mining program on Gallea, which was forwarded to Gallean government. The message stated that the colony desired to have control over the Helium-3 it mined, who they sold it to, and for what price. If their desire was not met, they would go on strike, and stop producing Helium-3 entirely. The Gallean government responded with offering to instead raise the workers' wages back to what was originally promised. The colony declined within a day, and added that if Gallea fails to make a choice soon, it would default to going on strike. The Gallean government was not willing to be rid of the cheap source of warp core material that Ganeimede presented.\u0000css\n    Neither Ganeimede or Gallea had any weapons of interplanetary bombardment, [!6 spacecraft] with weaponry, or even any [!7 combat spacesuits]. Seeing their foothold on the Aptha market starting to slip, the Gallean government quietly called an emergency [!8 GUN] summit on the matter. The Gallean leader, the Itascan [!9 Vice President], a [!10 Deorian] envoy, and a [!11 Tuine] envoy attended the summit. Gallea explained the problem on their hands, and offered 15% of the mineral rights of Ganeimede for 100 years to any party that would help bring the moon back under control. Deoria and Bius Tu expressed no interest, but the Itascan Vice President, after communicating with [!12 Itascus Himself], agreed to the terms. The Itascan government, at that time, had the second largest fleet of military spacecraft in the GUN. The Itascan military saw it as an easy mission, as Ganeimede's lack of any sort of military hardware was common knowledge. At the time, the GUN had a law stating that no two planetary nations could go to war with one another. And since Ganeimede had just under the population requirement to count as a colonized planet, ~16,100 out of the seemingly-arbitrary 16,384, it did not legally count as war. So, by starting hostilities towards Ganeimede, Itascus would not be breaking any international law.\n\n    Four days later, the [!13 I.T. Apocalypse] was in orbit of Ganeimede, acting as a Forward Operating Base for Itascus's occupation of the moon. The Itascan forces sent down eight [!14 Pelican-class ships], each containing three Itascan soldiers with small arms ([!15 pistols] and [!16 smgs]) and combat spacesuits. The Itascan army had no intention of opening fire on the unarmed colonists; they were ordered to prioritize causing no civilian casualties. But the Ganeimedics didn't know this, and they assumed the invaders to be dangerous.\u0000css\n    Each Itascan landing craft touched down at a large population center. They ordered each population center to allow them to land in the town's [!17 spaceport]. They had to request entry because, since Ganeimede has a miniscule atmosphere, every spaceport is inside an airtight environment, with each silo being sealed off with a hatch. Only two population centers obliged, though, meaning that the other six landing craft had to land on the Ganeimedic terrain near the towns, after which, they were still barred from entry on foot. The soldiers could not forcibly enter the towns, as breaching the structures would've undoubtedly caused civilian casualties.\n\n    Even though most towns on the surface were safe from harm from the Itascans (at the time), the Ganeimedics were aware of how poor their odds of coming out of this conflict victoriously, or even unscathed, were. And so, they recorded an audio message, and sent it off with their only warp-capable ship. This message was [!18 The Plea of Ganeimede], and caught the attention of the Tuine government, leading to them deciding to assist the lunar colony. The plea also gathered a large amount of attention from the citizens of [!19 Ghilly]. The Ghillians felt sympathetic towards the Gameimedics' plight, having started as a small moon colony themselves. But, while Ghilly did have a considerable population at the time, they didn't have the military resources to effectively help the colonists.\u0000css\n    Within two months, a large Tuine freighter ship stocked with weaponry, which couldn't legally be engaged by Itascan or Gallean combatants, warped to Ganeimede. The freighter entered a low orbit over the moon, starting short-range communications with Ganeimedic leadership. During which, the freighter refused all hails from the I.T. Apocalypse, though the ship was still broadcasting its [!20 callsign]. After confirming that the story told by the Ganeimedic messengers, the ones who were sent off with a copy of The Plea of Ganeimede, was accurate, they offered to help the colonists. The Tuine freighter stocked a landing craft with personal weaponry, and the lunar towns allowed the lander to park in each town's indoor rocket silo, one by one. With each landing, the local colonists were given dozens upon dozens of small arms, as well as combat spacesuits, to allow them to defend themselves.\n\n    The Itascan ground forces, which were still present, witnessed the Tuine lander visit each major Ganeimedic township, and reported it to the Apocalypse. The Apocalypse attempted, again, to hail to Tuine freighter, but the ship still refused to communicate. At this point, all eight major townships (excluding the two that allowed the Itascan occupation to enter) had weaponry, and they planned a coordinated attack. The colonists were also given a [!21 Quantum Comm] node, allowing for them to connect some devices to the galactic internet.\n\n    Under the cover of night, six Ganeimedic towns sent out small teams of colonists armed with [!22 ballistic weapons] and dawned in combat spacesuits. Each team stationed themselves at least 400 meters from an Itascan landing craft and waited for further instruction. Once all six teams were armed and in position, they fired in the direction of every exposed Itascan landing ship. The teams were instructed not to explicitly kill any of the invaders, only to make it known that they were now well-armed.\u0000css\n    The Itascan soldiers, stationed in their spacecraft, couldn't hear the sound of the automatic weaponry when stood outside in the vacuum, but from inside their landing craft, they could hear the bullets colliding with the hull. As the bullets were hitting the regolith around the ships, kicking up large clouds of dust, each of the six Itascan ships on the surface of Ganeimede simultaneously hailed the I.T. Apocalypse, declaring that they were being attacked by unidentified assailants, and were unable to return fire as they could not determine the direction from which the attacks were coming. Within minutes, the Itascan forces ordered all landing parties to return to orbit and rendezvous with the Apocalypse to regroup. Each of the six landing parties on the surface fled Ganeimede before re-docking to the Apocalypse. The two landing parties that were allowed entry into the towns' silos found themselves stuck, as both of the towns they were parked in locked down the silos as they gathered there, trapping them on Ganeimede.\n\n    The Apocalypse went radio silent as the occupation communicated with the Itascan leadership. Many groups of colonists had started celebrating as soon as the Itascan forces had left the surface, regardless of the fact that little had actually ended. Acting quickly, the Ganeimedic directors recorded another message. Though copies of the audio message itself have been lost, the terms were as follows: In exchange for the Itascan military stopping its occupation of Ganeimede, the six Itascan soldiers trapped in their rocket silos would be released. The Apocalypse would not accept any hail from any Ganeimedic or unrecognized craft. So instead, the colonists borrowed the transmitter from one of the captured Itascan landers. When the message was sent this time, it was acknowledged, but not responded to. And, for a short time, life continued as it was in the colony, even though the Apocalypse stayed in a high, polar orbit.\u0000css\n    The rebellion was attracting media coverage at this point. Media outlets had reporters stationed on and around the moon. Some were even allowed into the cabins and structures of the towns, interviewing the colonists on their thoughts about the encounter. Many of the colonists were surprised to hear the reporters referring to the event as a rebellion; the colony had not explicitly considered severing from the Gallean nation. Though, at that point, it seemed like it might have been inevitable, given how their homeworld had reacted to their resistance. Notably, media coverage of the event had reached the Itascan public. The new information was dense and concerning, in stark contrast to what little information was provided by state news.\n\n    A pair of Itascan [!23 Lucifer-Model] spacecraft warped into Ganeimedic space and entered a low orbit. Broadcasting their callsigns, they made their presence known to the colony. The Lucifer model of spacecraft was, and still is, designed for remote bombardment of a planet's surface. Onboard one of the Lucifers was the Itascan leader himself, [!24 Harry Lee], being present to oversee the endeavor. The ltascan president mass-broadcasted a message to the surface of the moon, relayed and amplified by the Apocalypse and the second Lucifer. “This is the Itascan president, Harry Lee. I am broadcasting to tell everyone in this planetary system that the Ganeimedic rebels have three sols(8.6 Galactic Days) to release the six Itascan prisoners of war, and return to production. Otherwise the largest structures on the planet will be bombarded from orbit.”\u0000css\n    Every population center on the moon received the message. Celebrations stopped. Journalists left the surface to watch from orbit. The Ganeimedic leadership was frantic, seeing their planet backed into a corner. Within hours, they contacted the Tuine military asking for their help, or at least their advice. A Tuine representative replied that they were unable to help; they weren't allowed to attack the Itascan fleet, and donating a frigate to the colonists would be expensive and likely only provoke a more violent response from the Itascan army. Instead, they informed the colonists that Ghillian leadership had been trying to contact them, securely. The colonists agreed to have their communications forwarded to Ghilly, opening talks with the fellow lunar world.\n\n    Through the media coverage of Ganeimede's predicament, the Ghillian people became sentimental to the colony's struggles. There was popular demand on Ghilly to help the colonists, and the government had been covertly formulating plans to assist the Ganeimedics, to help fix their perilous issue. Though, the Ghillians needed confirmation from the colony in order for them to help; their plan, the only plan they could theoretically work in the small amount of time allotted, required the Ganeimedic colony to commit to a full rebellion from Gallea. \n\n    The Ghillian proposition was transmitted to the other towns on the moon, and it was met with almost unanimous support. The colonists felt mistreated by their homeworld, even more so at that point than at the beginning of their strike; most of the colonists were elated when presented with a real opportunity to separate from the Gallean nation. The Ganeimedic leadership quickly sent their reply, accepting the Ghillians' help. And so, the Ganeimedic leadership was told the plan.\u0000css\n    Just seven days after the Itascan occupation broadcasted its warning message, five Ghillian ships appeared around Ganeimede, quickly landing as soon as they canceled their velocity. The five ships were [!25 Transit-class] spacecraft, equipped with the fastest warp drives, in total carrying over two-hundred Ghillian citizens. Again, all hails from the I.T. Apocalypse were refused. Despite the silence, the occupation forces did know the Ghillian plan, to a small extent; after the plan was discussed within the colony, details started to spread into the news as rumors. Immediately upon landing, the two-hundred Ghillian volunteers declared themselves citizens of Ganeimede, and the mayors of each of the towns formalized them as such. As soon as the transport ships landed on the moon (before the volunteers were actually given citizenship) the Ghillian and Ganeimedic governments declared that, since the colony now met the population requirement of 16,384, it legally counted as a populated world. Therefore, it could not legally be attacked under GUN law. As a show of good faith, the Ganeimedic colony released the six Itascan prisoners, allowing them to return to the Apocalypse unharmed.\u0000css\n    The galaxy got word of Ganeimede's new status, and they were largely supported by the general public. The rebellion was now a more popular topic than ever, being talked about across all the GUN's nations. Though the Itascan army was indifferent to the moon's declaration. The Itascan president, who was still in orbit of Ganeimede, was determined to secure the mineral rights and saw the Ganeimedic plot too ramshackle and impromptu to actually be considered legal. Though, the Itascan president was contacted by his social advisor back on their homeworld. The social advisor argued that, at this point, the general political backlash that would result from attacking the colony would far outweigh any boost to warp drive production would be worth. The president was reluctant to hear this from his advisor, even being described as vivid. Eventually, he relented, and ordered the Itascan ships to silently return to Itascus.\n\n    And so, without a single life lost, Ganeimede gained its independence, and Bius Tu and Ghilly and strong allies. Only a year later, at the next [!26 GUN Meeting], Ghilly and Ganeimede announced that they were forming together into a union, the nation now known as Ghillymede.",

        "data": "css\n   A Combat Spacesuit is simply a [!1 spacesuit] that has been designed or modified for use in combat. These spacesuits can be augmented with light armor, heavy armor, energy armor, or any variation or combination of the three.\n\n   Creating a spacesuit designed to sustain damage (while keeping its operator alive) is a daunting challenge. There is an inherent fragility to equipment that is designed to maintain a thin, flexible barrier between a human and hard vacuum. Since a single breach in a standard spacesuit could lead to the death of the person inside within minutes, changes would need to be made if troops were to be expected to be fired at with light munitions and survive.\u0000css\n   There are two main types of Combat Spacesuits: Light Combat Spacesuits, and Heavy Combat Spacesuits.\n\n   Light Combat Spacesuits vary only slightly from standard spacesuits. Notably, Light Combat Spacesuits have every non-bending surface covered by an armor plate. Every joint on the suit (that can't be covered with a rigid plate without completely restricting movement) is protected by metal cuffs that stem from adjacent armor plates. These cuffs are placed at the elbows, shoulders, knees, and ankles. Since the waist does not have a metal cuff to protect the airtight inner spacesuit, they are instead by a veil or curtain of ballistic weave. Light Combat Spacesuits are dawned by military personnel who operate in the outermost cabins of combat [!2 spacecraft], whom are most likely to be struck by shrapnel from enemy fire. Though, those on inner cabins of military craft (or any cabin of non-military craft) are more often provided normal spacesuits, as they have less of a dexterity loss when compared to combat spacesuits.\n   \n   Heavy Combat Spacesuits are used in rare occasions where there is a need for infantry on a planet without an atmosphere. Heavy Combat Spacesuits more closely resemble [!3 power armor] than any kind of standard spacesuit. Since it's expected that these suits will be struck by direct fire, they are much, much bulkier than Light Combat Spacesuits. They typically consist of three layers: the inner spacesuit, which keeps the operator alive; an inner layer of ballistic weave wrapped over the spacesuit, designed to catch any shrapnel coming from the outer later; and an outer layer of thick armor plating. Heavy Combat Spacesuits can weigh up to 70 kilograms and greatly dampens a soldier's agility. Though, since the use of the armor is restricted to low-gravity worlds lacking an atmosphere",

Your current path is displayed above the page data. for example, the path of this very article is \"/HOME/HELP/BASIC_NAV\". \n\n  There are a few commands used to navigate around Netpedia, and here we will cover some of them.\n\n  The command \"cd ..\" is a special command that tells your machine to make your path go down by one layer. This means it will remove the last element from your path string. For example, lets say if you were on the path \"/ROOT/NATIONS/GCP/MAIN\" and typed the command \"cd ..\", it would remove the last element from your path, meaning that your path would then be \"/ROOT/NATIONS/GCP\".\n\n  Another command is \"back\". This command takes you to the page you were on previously. For example, if you were on a page called \"page 1\" and followed a link that took you to a page called \"page 2\", you could then type the command \"back\" to return to the page you were on previously. And if you were to type \"back\" once more, you would be taken to the page you were viewing before \"page 1\", and so on.",

        "data": "css\n    A Lifeform Archetype is something used to classify a living thing's Body Layout (or, in common terms, a life form's shape).  There are three classes of Lifeform Archetype, which are Anima, Flora, and Micra.  The Anima class includes all visible, mobile living things, such as [!1 Humans] or other animals.  The Flora class of life forms broadly describes plants, and other non-motile living things.  The Micra class of body layouts generally describe microscopic (usually unicellular) life.   \n    \n    Lifeform Archetypes, as descriptors, are not exhaustive, and simply act as a mnemonic, or to quickly, generally describe a life, regardless of its [!2 vivotype].\u0000css\nThe specific lifeform archetypes are described, class by class, as follows:\n    Anima:\n        Humanoid -- Humanoids are bipedal creatures that stand upright on feet or hindlegs.  They usually have forward-facing heads on the tops of their torso, and (at least) two appendages designed for manipulating their environment (arms).\n        Canifelinoid -- Canifelinoid are Quadrapedal (or Nai'chujious, meaning using all legs to walk) creatures with bodies optimized for hunting, with a common trait being longer muzzles to fit more teeth.  Canifelinoids are typically carnivorous or biovorous.\n        Bovoid -- Bovoids, like Canifelinoids, are quadrapedal or naichujious.  Unlike Canifelinoids, however, Bovoids are typically herbivorous, commonly boasting defensive body features (such as horns, antlers, bone plates, etc.) for defending against predators.\n        Avioid -- Creatures with Avioid body archetypes are creatures built for flight.  These creatures almost exclusively have wings, and other organs for facilitating flight if not.  Most Aviods can be recognized as birds.\n        Insectoids -- Insectoids are typically small, simple creatures, with few individual internal organs.  Many Insectoids are parasites, and few paracites are not of Insectoid archetypes.\n        Tineoid -- This category of archetypes describes worms, or other smooth, (usually long,) creatures with reduced, few, or no exterior bodily features.\n        Pisceoid -- Most commonly fish.  These creatures have short, flat appendages (fins) to maneuver around in fluids.  Their bodies are usually more rounded and sleek.\n        Radioid -- Radioids are creatures which have bodies that have more than two degrees of radial symmetry.  This symmetry does not have to be perfect.\u0000css\n    Flora:\n        Votoid -- Votoids are stationary lifeforms (plants) that consist of many blades stemming from the soil (or from whatever the plant is growing in).\n        Arboid -- Arboids are typically large, sturdy plants.  They commonly have stalks made out of a strong material.  Arboid's are typically common trees, and vice versa.\n        Ambuloid -- Ambuloids are simple plants usually composed of one main body and little else.  Common mushrooms are a good example of Ambuloids, as they have a single main body (the cap and stem) with some roots under it.  These life forms do not rely a lot on photosynthesis, and subsequently don't require a plumage.\n        Permioid -- Permioids are stationary life forms that have parts permiating (extending into and filling) some of the area around them.  For example, bushes are Permioids since their branches extend outward to maximize the bush's cross-sectional area (in order to maximize sunlight exposure).\n        Vineaoid -- Vineaoids are life forms that hang off another structure, and rely on the other structure for support.\n        Algeoid -- Nebulous, homogenous life forms of coordinated cells.  The most common form of Algeoid is algae, or some mold colonies.\n        \n    Micra:\n        Viroid -- Viroids are microscopic entities, typically smaller than most cells, which rely on cells for reproduction.  Viroids are usually only some enzymes, a vessel, and some rogue DNA.  Because of their simplicity, some scholars argue that Viroids should not be considered \"alive\".\n        Bacterioid -- Bacterioids are simple, solitary, single-celled creatures.\n        Amoeboid -- Ambuloids are single cells with malleable, prehensile membranes.  Amoeboids typically maneuver using pseudopods, and are predatory in nature, meaning they devour other cells.",

Many subscribed to the ideas of [!2 Human-Prefectionism], believing non-[!3 F-type] humans, or even just any non-Tuines to be fundamentally bestial or subhuman.\n\n    Tuines born after the 40s, growing up in the era of trade and transport with other worlds, had a more relaxed view of alien races compared to their parents.  Many still saw them as different, for one reason or another, as the values of Human-Perfectionism still lingered in this generation.  Though, through interacting with other species, the more-extreme views of the past generation were worn down, convincing many that F-Type and B-Type species weren't so different.\n\n    More modern Tuines, born after the year 86, have grown up in the coming age of the [!4 Galactic Confederation of Planets], where interstellar transport and communications are easier and cheaper than ever.

        "data": "css\n    In the beginning, Gallean life was a cold existence. Without fire, they huddled primitively in small, temporary, buildings made of packed snow and ice to shelter them from the cold. Few notable events happened as they traveled nomadically across Gallea's rocky surface. Though, in this time, their local folklore and [!1 religion] was greatly developed.\n\n    It wasn't until around the year -12,000 P.W. that they began to use dead plant matter as fuel for fires. This allowed for permanent settlements to be constructed. Within a matter of decades, many gatherings of ancient Galleats developed methods of agriculture, and subsequently animal husbandry, to sustain their sedentary lifestyles. The population quadrupled from 20,000 to 80,000 globally by the year -6,000. Annual growth had been slow and sluggish as surplus food was rare, leading to the development of closely-knit tribes in this 6,000-year timeframe. Some of these tribes would grow into small republics or kingdoms. Wars would occur and the population was stagnant until the year -821, when the legendary inventor, Xerlia Veras Gheriz, hailing from the Veraz tribe, studied the botany of Gallean plants and discovered much more efficient methods of producing heat energy, kickstarting a small industrial revolution across the planet.\u0000css\n    The revolution affected the planet's scientific progression, as well as its society. The new heating methods even allowed for food to be grown in more enclosed spaces, safe from the weather. This allowed farmers to breed out the hardy, unpalatable, weather-resistant traits in favor of breeding in more efficient, and more fruitful traits, making the food more edible. This led to a surplus of food, and population boomed, reaching 100 million globally by the year -500. This continued growth aided in letting ancient galleats specialize in their skills, as not every person had to commit to producing food. This led The new technology that used the friction heat tech soon powered and heated homes by -400.  The advancement of science continued, bringing new ideas on trade and lifestyle. \n\n    The population was reaching 1 billion by the year -114. And around this time the [!2 Gallean World War] was set into motion. Out of the war came a new global government that forsook the old tribal divisions from whence it came, and focused on the world's progress at large. It took six years, until the year -40, for the government to stabilize its control and functionally tax its citizens. The new management was met with little political resistance, as most citizens saw it as a new hope for a Late Industrialist utopia. The new global government was built around the ideas of equality, government-provided welfare, and a republican governmental system.\u0000css\n    With the globe underneath it, the new government began looking to the stars, and by -35 it had placed its first simple satellites in orbit. With what primitive mechanical calculations they had, they operated relatively efficiently. As the public's eyes were turned towards the stars as well, with promises of immense resources and prosperity, their field of space travel advanced very quickly (when compared to other homeworlds) bringing unparalleled prosperity to their star system. Each year, more and more resources were devoted to space exploration, establishing bases across the star system of [!3 Gavia] and landing a human on the neighboring planet [!4 Norlia] by the year -32. Since Norlia was so similar to Gallea, in its environment and temperature, it was discovered (based on samples) that some places on the surface of the planet would be able used to grow hardier Gallean plants with little modification. In the year -29, another mission was sent, the theory about growing plants was tested, and found to be true. Upon discovery that farmland was viable on the surface of another planet, the planetary government built a colony ship, promising vast swaths of land and prosperity for anyone willing to start a new life on Norlia. In the year -27, the first permanent colony was established on Norlia.\u0000css\n    As the Gallean race became a multiplanetary species, they needed to create infrastructure to keep multiple planets in communication. They developed radio systems using massive radio dishes, that can be turned and pointed at any target to communicate with them. Some curious Galleats pointed dishes towards nearby stars with unusually-high amounts of radio noise, hoping that they could decipher something from the static, and maybe even confirm other forms of life. The starbound dishes didn't yield much until in the year -8, when they received a clear, intentional message from 9 light years away. The message was sent from a local star, [!5 Simia]. The message came from the planet [!6 Deoria], and the Galleans immediately replied. This transmission was one of the first of [!7 The Great Contact]. As soon as the transmission from the Deorians was confirmed, it was taken by the government, and transmitted to every TV, radio, house, and business as breaking news. Gallea maintained contact with Deoria, and later [!8 Itascus], over the next decade, but without any sort of translation, the raw audio transmissions were nearly useless.\n\n    An Itascan envoy visited in the year 1, and gifted the gallean race the materials and instructions to build a [!9 warp drive], along with other technologies, as part of [!10 The Warp Endowment Campaign]. After training competent translators for the languages of other worlds, they met with the other planetary leaders in the year 10 and became a founding member of the GUN. To their surprise, they realized many other planets and forms of life were quite different from them. They searched endlessly for an icy planet in their observatories and with what few warp-capable scouts they had, not finding much besides icy moons of gas giants. They started to realize just how lucky they were to originate in a system with two habitable planets. Over the course of their search, they became more acquainted with galactic life and commerce.\u0000css\n    After discovering a potentially suitable planet 13 light years away in the year 41, they sent a warp scout and confirmed via landing crew that this planet might also be capable of supporting Gallean life, with a bit of terraforming, that is. This new planet was [!11 Zerania], and the Gallean government realized that they would need many more warp-capable ships in order to reasonably colonize the new world. The Government opted to start a program; seeing that their moon, Ganeimede, had useable amounts of Helium-3 on its surface, which is used in the production of warp cores. Zerania was successfully colonized in the year 47.\n\n    After [!12 The Ganeimedic Rebellion], Gallean command and government were thrown into chaos, feelings of inferiority and failure spread throughout the homeworld, as well as the other colonies. This anxiety marked the beginning of the Armament Era, lasting from 47 to 68. A deep fear was instilled in the Gallean people; in the wake of the loss of the moon of their own homeworld, it became a popular belief that the Gallean nation was gravely under equipped for extraterrestrial combat. This era was seen as one of technological progress. However, the era had its grim aspects; combat training was taught in schools, military technology was prioritized over many other programs, and the army of Gallea swelled with recruits. [!13 Personal weaponry] was legalized and licensed for use in self-defense, and in case a foreign power were to invade the planet. Their relationships noticeably soured with foreign powers, feeling betrayed by the other nations that acted against them in the rebellion of their moon. During the Armament Era, many Galleats feared that it was likely that a foreign power would see their nation as weak, and decide to invade. Although largely unjustified, these fears became deeply rooted in Galleat society. This era also saw the construction of planet-wide and orbital defenses around and on Gallean planets.\u0000css\n    The societal changes from Armament Era were challenged in the late 60s, as Galleats that were infants during the loss of their moon aged into maturity and became influential citizens. This was also due to no major conflicts occuring that could justify such a large military stockpile. Newer ideas of free trade and disarmament became popular throughout the colonies and homeworld. This movement was known as the “Rationalist Uprising”. Being mostly peaceful, they elected rationalist leaders into office, officially declaring the “irrational era” over in 68. The movement embraced the fields of technological research. The research was no longer for war, but for the advancement of all sentient species; developments that were previously created for military use were shared publicly, spreading to the rest of the GUN, developments such as advanced computation electronics used for ballistics. Gallean military enlistments plummeted as enlisting was seen as foolish, and the army deflated into very small numbers. This left only the most trained, and extremely professional fighting forces as the nation's military. The military itself was still supported by rationalists, but only for rare uses of professional soldiers as opposed to conscripts. The rationalist era is marked as spanning from the year 68 to the year 78.\n\n    The rationalist era ended slowly as the once strong, uniform movement splintered into smaller and more specific parties. However, Gallean society as a whole agreed it was in the best interest to restructure the government into a new socialist republic, where the Senate was the supreme body of governance, and the government provided all needed aid to its citizens. And its citizens, in turn, would provide all the needed work for their government. This continued on as parties continued to fracture, eventually leaving political alignment to be defined by a “Rationalist Spectrum”.\u0000css\n    This marked the beginning of the Stable Era, sometimes called the ‘Relaxed' period of Gallean history. Political movements became comparatively moderate. Even the professional army was content. The economy was adequately stabilized using a combination of Socialism and Capitalism to run its markets. This era spanned from the year 79 to the present, as Galleans have more-or-less maintained status quo and kept equity among its citizens. Though one aspect of Gallean culture has broken the stagnation, the computing industry. Many international tech companies have offices on Gallea as a result. The small, but modern, military polices the streets and trade routes with a combination of drones & surveillance algorithms. As of now, the nation is in its most peaceful period.",

The .380 hold-out pistol costs anywhere between $200-$300.\n\n This gun was invented in 32 P.W. by [!1 Tuine] Intelligence Forces with an intended use for their espionage and counterintelligence agencies, as well as for their special forces as a last resort weapon. It was considered standard issue, and was regulated by said Tuine intelligence forces. However, other agencies around the [!2 GCP] soon adopted similar variants with the same purpose. Now, they are still carried by some intelligence agencies and special forces units, but also by anyone who has the ability to purchase one as civil variants were created on planets such as [!3 Itascus] around the year 43 P.W..",

This weapon has an effective range of 1.8 kilometers when equipped with its long range scope (for which it has a Medium Rail mount on the top of the barrel).  It handles smoothly, but must be fired from a prone position.  If fired from the upright position, it could cause breakage of the shoulder or loss of balance due to the power of the rifle. This weapon is more for use against military equipment rather than military combatants.  However, it can be used for both.\n\n    Brand new, this weapon runs on the market for about $8500.  On the civilian after-market, the gun costs more around $7000.  The price of the military-grade scope does not factor into these figures.\n\n       This weapon was created as an experimental anti-material military sniper rifle by the Tuine Government. It was considered, in its early years of creation, to be one of the best anti-vehicle weapons due to its effective range and stopping power.  This weapon was extremely monitored by the Tuine government and was not allowed in civilian hands.  A few years after its creation, other military forces on major planets began to develop a similar breed of anti-material sniper rifles.  Today, most governments regulate these rifles for military use only. Though there are exceptions for planets like Itascus. Itascus, having practically no laws on gun control, have this available on the civilian market, which stands as the easiest way to purchase one.",

It is currently lacking a standard definition for weapon modifications]\n\n    There are two common types of connectors for weapon addons: Rail Mounts and Barrel Mounts\n\n    Rail Mounts come in three common sizes, Small (S), Medium (M), and Big (L).  The varying sizes are for different types of addons.  For example, smaller rails are used for smaller addons (like laser pointers or flashlights), while larger rails are for things like scopes, which weigh more.  Rail mounts are usually placed on the top of a weapon (for use with sights), but are occasionally placed on the bottom or side (for laser points or grips).\n    Many rail mounts are able to support multiple addon sizes with a single rail. (Ex: a weapon may have an \"ML\" rail, meaning it can connect to medium and large addons)  Some weapons have nonstandard railmounts, usually designed for nonstandard addons, and are not compatible with standard pieces.\n\n    Barrel Mounts are screw-on or latch-on connectors on the ends of the barrels of weapons.  Due to the large variety of barrel sizes, there are no standard measurements for barrel connectors.  Instead, barrel connectors (and addons that use them) are labeled using exact measurements (Ex: a silencer that screws onto the end of a 2-centimeter barrel would be labeled \"2cm Barrel Connector\").",

It is primarily used in closer range situation or used to quickly take out a threat.  It has a maximum effective range of 137.16 meters, which is less than the average pistol.\n\n    It costs about $350 dollars when bought from a distributor, and its price only drops to an average of $300 when bought on the civilian aftermarket.\n\n    This gun was originally manufactured on Bius Tu as an alternative to the more bulky 9mm pistol.  The engravings on the weapon were more for aesthetic purpose but, soon became a signature of the weapon's design, and as an allure to the Tuine public. Some planets have made similar versions of this weapon, however, they have low popularity as they are seen as just a weaker version of a 9mm pistol.  Today, it's not really used for anything besides self-defense.  It's design makes it slightly more concealable than other pistols despite it being generally considered weaker than other pistols out on the market.",

Unfortunately, as a prototype, it ended up having approximately a 50% mortality rate.  The [!3 Itascan Government] ended up making the weapon standard for swat and riot police in 17 p.w, but the weapon still had approximately 35% mortality rate.  Today, after the diffusion of the weapon type to other planets, the model has improved dramatically to only a 20% mortality rate. It is now considered as standard riot police gear on most planets.  Though, more commonly in non-police use, this weapon is now used with normal, non-rubber rounds.\n\nSpecial Information:\n    Weapon has a 4/20 chance to functionally convert rubber pellets into normal pellets.",

It has a medium length barrel and can fire unusually-powerful rounds.  In unskilled hands, the weapon can be harder to use due to its recoil, despite being outfitted with a gas-compressed recoil system to compensate. The gun itself handles rather smoothly but requires upkeep far more often than most pistols. This weapon is bulkier than other pistols so it is far less easy to conceal or use in a stealthy fashion. \n\n    This gun costs about $700-$850 on the common market.  The gold variant costs $1500 to $2000.  Sale of the gold variant is frowned upon, as it was only intended for use by the [!1 presidents of Itascus].\n\n    This gun was invented under orders of the Itascan president [!2 Kyle Stanley], who needed a pistol to “really make a statement”.  For the time, this weapon was considered a marvel of engineering by the Itascans.  They were able to create modifications to the gas-compressed recoil system invented by the Tuines.  It came into common use by select military units during the [!3 Itascan World War], and soon was opened to the consumer market.  This pistol has become a symbol of Itascus, as each president since Kyle Stanley has carried one with a golden chassis, and has thus earned the rather comical nickname “Itascan Peacemaker”. Today, the gun is still used by many planets, primarily in [!4 Itascus].  While the gas-compressed recoil system is harder to maintain, many people favor this weapon for its superior stopping power as a pistol.",

It works by halting the user's menstrual cycle, rendering conception impossible in all currently-known human species, and most known animal species as well.  Ferilin dissolves very easily in water, making fluids an effective medium of application.\n\n    In ancient times, Ferilin was derived from certain plants on [!1 La'Foy] which were thought to be [!2 magical] in the nature of their effects.  While, in reality, the useful effects of the plants were actually achieved through chemical means.  In the late 20s, Ferilin was discovered to be derivable from simple chemical processes, making it producible on the large scale.  This ease of production is credited as the reason why Ferilin is cheap enough (to produce) that it was able to be deployed large-scale on [!3 Armalai].\u0000css\n    Ferilin can be potentially problematic when consumed in large quantities.  When overdosing on Ferilin, a user's physical body will cease to grow.  This does not mean that the user will \"stay young forever\", or much less become immortal; the user will still age and expire naturally.  An overdose simply means that the user will cease to develop, stunting their growth.  Save for drowning in it, there is currently no known way to fatally overdose on Ferilin.",

Primarily, it is used in [!1 Packer Shots] as a numbing agent/painkiller for patching wounds.  Theracaine also comes in cream form for non-wound topical applications, and in pills so it can act as a general painkiller.  In higher doses, Theracaine will act as a whole-body sedative.  Theracaine, across all [!2 GCP] nations, is either perscription only, emergencies only, or an outright illegal substance.\n\n    Theracaine is a common compound found in plants of every known [!3 vivotype], and therefore is a very common, and popular, endorphiat/depressant substance.  Like most endorphiats, Theracaine can be quickly removed from a user's system by dosing them with a medicine containing [!4 Terinol].  Terinol can be used to keep a user from dying from an overdose.\u0000css\n    In the case of a nonfatal overdose, a user may feel dizzy and/or overly-tired, exhibit slow speech with shallow breathing, and have an unstable gait.  If the user is of a species that has visible pupils (pupils visually discernable from the user's corneas), they will likely be made to appear very small as the corneas relax.  If someone recieves a fatal overdose of Theracaine, they will stop standing and may even fall unconscious.  At this point, the user will become unresponsive.  After this, the user's breaths will become progressively more shallow until breathing stops entirely.  The recipient of the fatal dose will expire from suffocation within minutes after they have succumb to respiratory depression.",

They were invented by a [!1 Tuine] military contractor in the year 32 as a tool to immediatly stop bleeding from combat-related wounds.  Packer Shots contain a moderate dose of [!2 Theracaine] to numb the typically-extreme pain of wounds gained through combat.  Specifically, Packer Shots are used to temporarily close bullet wounds.\u0000css\n    A standard packer shot consists of a seven-centimeter-long, one-centimeter-wide metal or hard plastic cylinder.  On the side of the cylinder is a tall button along the edge.  Inside the cylinder is a pellet of condensed fibers connected to a spring-loaded piston.  When the button is pressed, the spring is released, ejecting the fiber pellet into whatever is immediately in front of the opening on the cylinder.  Within the pellet is two chemicals: The first is a 150mg dose of Theracaine to numb the wound, and the second is reactive foam chemical.  This foam chemical, when making contact with a water-containing substance (such as blood), quickly expands and hardens.  The use of this foam is intended to immediately stop bleeding.  The pellet itself, when not expanded, is a cylinder which is almost one centimeter in diameter and three centimeters in height.  The pellet is specifically compacted to expand in the plane perpendicular to the axis through which it was inserted.  Packer shots come with a small elastic cap over the opening to keep the active chemicals from coming into contact with water when not in use.  This cap is meant to be removed before the packer pellet is applied.\n    \n    A Packer Shot is only a temporary solution to an injury.  If the wound was caused by a [!3 Ballistic weapon], a packer shot will not remove the bullet, it will simply be layered over it.  Wounds should not be allowed to heal around a Packer Shot Pellet, as this would create a permanent opening in the flesh.  After application, the recipient of a packer shot should see a physician at their earliest convenience to have the bullet removed and the wound dressed.",

A Qi entity only exists as long as the charged Qi particles within it remain contained and remain charged. \n    \n    Qi Entites have a homogenity property, meaning that all charged Qi particles within have the same spin, allignment, and \"Qi heat\".  The \"Qi heat\" describes the speed at which the entity's Qi particles move within the entity.  All three of these properties determine the entity's \"function\".  The entity's function determines how the entity acts, and some functions can be very useful.\n\n    On top of having different functions, Qi Entities can have physical protrusions called \"links\".  These Links can connect to nearby Qi Entities, binding them, and allowing them to influence one another.  Collections of Qi Entites bound together are called Qi Structures.\n    \n    Linking Qi Entities to create structures, combined with setting Qi Entity functions, results in a useful craft called Qi Invocation/Qi Programming, though some older circles still refer to this as \"spellcasting\"/\"enchanting\" or simply \"magic\".\u0000css\n    A Qi Entity, given time, will naturally dissipate and cease to exist as the charged, energy-baring particles within it either escape or naturally discharge.  Though, Qi Entities manifesting in solids last thousands of times longer than those mainifesting in fluids (such as water or air).  This is thought to be because a Qi Entity in a fluid, which naturally attempts to maintain a spherical shape, is constantly being subjected to small currents which whisk off a small amount of qi-containing material.  For example, if a Qi Entity was created and manifested in air, it would be pushed around the environment by air currents.  But this is not what causes the energy loss; the loss is caused by fluid currents within the entity pushing Qi-manifested material out of the sphere (therefore discharging the particles and losing the energy) and pulling non-Qi-containing material into the entity's sphere.  Eventually, this causes a total loss of energy in the entity, causing it to dissolve.  Entities manifesting in solids do not have this problem (more accurately, the extent to which they have this problem is negligable).  Instead, Qi Entities in solids dissipate through the natural decay of the charged Qi particles within them (into uncharged Qi particles).\n    \n    Since Qi entities are a component of all known human species' anatomies, most people can produce a programmable Qi Entity from their own body.  These Qi Entities can be reprogrammed to perform a function different than the one it performed while in their body.  They can then be used to make complex Qi Structures.  Though, the act of pulling a Qi Entity out of one's own body is a difficult skill to learn, as it's not something humans are supposed to naturally do.  Despite this, some people spend years of their lives studying and training themselves to be able to extract Qi Entities from thier bodies so that they can perform Qi Invocation without the assistance of a tool.",

The purpose of an Advisory Council is to help advise the ministers they are assigned to.  However, the ministers are not required to listen to their assigned advisors.  Though ministers not required to listen to their advisors, they are allowed to offload their responsibilities to their advisors.  The Advisory Councils are the only position within the greater Tuine government that are elected by the people of Bius Tu, with exception to the Minister of Defence.  Advisors serve 5-year terms with no term limit.",

Due to the loss of nearly 45% of the Counterintelligence and Espionage Field Agents based on [!4 Itascus] during the war, the departments were in serious need of new agents to fill the empty positions.  So Alexi put in place the Early Bird Espionage Program. \n    \n    The program focused on children from around the ages of 6-10 who showed heightened physical and/or intellectual prowess in [!5 Primary School] and train them to be Counterintelligence or Espionage Field Agents.  These children would be moved into special schooling environment and taught, from then on, in the arts of coercion and espionage.  The Program was able to produce hyper-specialized, excellently-trained Field Agents of young adult age within 10-12 years.  This also meant that, since they were so young, they could serve for their assorted agencies for longer than individuals who entered as adults.  After the war, this program produced many Field agents and Spies that were then tasked with gathering intel and information.  This Program proved to be advantageous for the national departments, so it continued up until the year 108 P.W. when the GCP was reformed.",

This specific anxiety disorder was originally thought to be a subclassification of Agoraphobia —— an anxiety disorder in which people fear and avoid places or situations that might cause them to feel like they're helpless or unable to escape.  More recently, the condition has been found to be at least partially psychosomatic.  People with SpAD often experience panic attacks where they begin to lose attachment to reality, believing they are about to die to the endless vacuum of space. \n\n    This type of anxiety disorder is usually triggered by the use/prospective use of space craft and interplanetary travel, however, as most citizens of the [!2 GCP] don't utilize space travel there are significantly fewer incidences of SpAD than there would be otherwise. In a recent survey conducted by the IPC, less than 1% of people with SpAD continue to make regular interplanetary trips after initial diagnosis. The most common medicine prescribed to treat SpAD is [!3 Visage], less often referred to by its active ingredient, [!4 Hyporezide].\u0000css\n    People with SpAD often have at least a few of the following symptoms:\n\n        - Crippling sense of impending doom or danger\n        - Shortness of breath/trouble breathing\n        - Nausea\n        - Chest pain\n        - Chronic migraines\n        - Vertigo\n        - Passing out\n        - Tingling sensation in extremities\n        - Uncontrollable feelings of spinning or floating, even if standing still or laying down\n        - Detachment from reality",

        "data": "css\n    Cascading Branch Networking Protocol is a Machine Networking Protocol used throughout the [!1 GCP].  It is used to transfer data between connected computers, and can even be used between computers on different planets.\n    \n    A CBNP network is a layered network.  Every connected machine/router in the network is connected to a single machine/router.  The router the device connects to is considered one layer \"above\" the device, and all devices that connect thought -it- are considered a layer \"below\".  Every device has a single 8-bit routing number (ranging from 1 to 254) assigned to it by the router above it or manually.  No two devices connected to the same router on the layer above can have the same routing address, as this would cause problems.\n    When data is sent over a CBNP network, it first travels \"up\" the network by a certain number of layers.  This is called the \"ascent\" stage.  After that the data packet enters the \"decent\" stage.  Within the address is a list of the routing numbers of every router on the way down to the recipient device, ending with the recipient's routing number followed by zero (since routing numbers can't be zero, this defines the end of the address).\n    CBNP has two addressing modes: Relative and Absolute.  In Relative Addressing, the \"ascent\" stage lasts for a specified number of layers before it decends.  In Absolute Addressing, the packet ascends all the way to the router at the highest layer on the network, called the \"head router\", before it decends.  For CBNP addresses using Absolute Addressing, the number of layers the packet needs to ascend before decending is set to 255.\u0000css\n    \n    The following is a diagram of a CBNP network:\n    \n                    X[N/A]\n                    |\n        +-----------+-+--------------+\n        |             |              |\n        A[3A]         B[42]          C[8F]\n        |                            |\n  +-----+-----+                +-----+-----+\n  |           |                |     |     |\n  D[05]       E[C8]            F[FD] G[62] H[B9]\n              |                      |\n        +-----+-----+                |\n        |     |     |                |\n        I[01] J[02] K[03]            L[01]\n        \n    In this diagram, each letter (A through L) is a device/router on the network.  The 'X' at the top is the head router.  Next to each letter is the machines routing number.  As an example, if machine 'J' in the diagram wants to send something to machine 'G' (using Absolute Addressing), it would use the address \"FF-8F-B9-00\".  The \"FF\" is 255 in decimal, and tells the routers above it to carry the packet all the way up to the head router ('X').  After that, the head router reads the second number, \"8F\", and sends it to the router below it with the routing number of 8F (which is machine 'C').  Then, machine 'C' reads the next number, 'B9', and sends it to the machine under it with the routing number 'B9', which is machine 'H'.  Machine 'H' gets the packet and reads the next number as '00', and then machine 'H' knows that the packet is intended for it, and accepts it.\n    For a real-world example, let's imagine that devices 'F' and 'J' are a [!2 telephones].  The user of telephone 'F' wishes to call telephone 'E', so they dial \"FF-3A-C8-02-00\".  The first number will bring the packet up to the Head Router 'X', the second down to the router 'A', the third to router 'E', and the final number '00' terminates the decent.\u0000css\n    Cascading Branch Networking Protocol uses collections of bytes (that can be transferred over a network) called packets.  Packets can vary greatly in size, being anywhere from under 100 bytes to 64 Kibibytes in total.  A CBNP packet consists of Five sections, which are the following (in order):\n        \n        Header Section\n        Recipient Address Section\n        Data Section\n        Return Address Section\n\n    Header Section:\n        The first two bytes of the header section are the values \"55\" and \"AA\" for a sort of integrity check\n        The third byte is the length (in bytes) of the address, including the terminator.\n        The fourth and fifth bytes are a 16-bit number describing the \"channel\", which is used to identify what type of traffic the packet is for (ex: phone call, web browsing, file transfer).\n        The sixth and seventh bytes are a 16-bit number describing the size of the Data Section (in bytes)\n        The ninth byte is a number representing which routing number in the address is the next routing number to use as the packet 'decends'.  This number is called the \"Address Offset Byte\" (If this number is zero, it means the packet is in the 'ascent' stage.  If the number is nonzero, it means the packet is in the 'decent' stage.)\n    \n    The Recipient Address Section contains the recipient's CBNP address, with each number being one byte\n        If the packet is in the 'accent' stage, the first byte of the recipient's address (the counter for how many layers to 'ascend') is decremented.  If this decrement results in the number being zero (meaning the packet has reached the end of its 'ascent'), then the Address Offset Byte is set to \"1\", marking the start of the 'decent' stage.  If the router handling the packet is a Head Router, it will unconditionally begin the 'decent' stage.\u0000css\n    The Data Section is the data contained within the packet meant to be delivered to the recipient\n    \n    The Return Address Section contains the return address and is constructed during transit\n        The first byte is the length of the return address (in bytes)\n        The rest of the Return Address Section is the return address\n        \n        During the 'ascent' stage, each router that the packet travels through adds its router number to the end of the return address.  It also increments the byte describing the size of the return address.\n        Once the packet ends the 'ascent' stage, the router handling it appends the return address with '00', terminating it.\n        For every layer the packet passes through in the 'decent' stage, the router it's passing through increments the byte representing the number of layers the return address should 'ascend'.\u0000css\n    As an example, lets say we wanted to send the numbers zero through seven in a packet from machine 'H' in the previous diagram (absolute address: \"FF-8F-B9-00\") to machine 'K' (absolute address: \"FF-3A-C8-03-00\").  For the purpose of this example, let's say the Channel being used is \"ABCD\".\n    \n    When the packet is first sent, the bytes making it up will look like the following:\n    \n55 AA 04 AB CD 00 08 00 FF 3A C8 03 00\n└────────Header───────┘ └───Address──┘\n\n00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00\n└─────────Data────────┘ └┴─Return Address\n\n    By the time the packet reaches the recipient, it will be the following:\n    \n55 AA 04 AB CD 00 08 04 FD 3A C8 03 00\n└────────Header───────┘ └───Address──┘\n\n00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 04 03 8F B9 00\n└─────────Data────────┘ └─Ret.

Because of the low content of Carbon used in the Steel (%1), the alloy is more ductile as opposed to brittle, and will not become a dangerous projectile itself when impacted.\n\n    Due to the high density of the Uranium in the alloy, the metal can easily absorb the kinetic energy of a bullet ( according to the fundamental principles of dynamics: The sum of all external forces applied to a system divided by its mass gives its instantaneous acceleration, so a greater mass leads to lower acceleration).\n\n    All of these factors make Wiron a very useful alloy for protection of military assets.

The station is made for two tasks: constructing ships and harboring the higher management the Exospace company.  The station's body is easily recognizable by its red & black paint scheme.  The traffic of the space station can be divided into three categories, constructed ships leaving the station, transfer of personnel, and supply shipments.\n\n    The station itself has four distinct sections: the Core, the Docking Bay, the Shipyard, and the Rings. \n    \"The Rings\" is a collection of four [!2 Gravity Rings] stacked on each others' axes.  Each ring is 100 meters in diameter and 9 meters in width.  Each ring in the array rotates opposite of its neighbor(s) for stability.  The rings hold living spaces, recreational spaces, and office spaces.  Each ring is tuned to produce 1.04 Gs.\u0000css\n    The Docking Bay is 32-meter long cylinder at 4-meters in diameter and is connected at either end to the Rings and the Core.  It has eight [!3 Type-A Docking Ports] for transport ships and four [!4 Type-C Docking Ports] for cargo.   \n    The Core is the the center hub of the space station, and contains the stations nuclear generator, life support systems, and storage. \n    The last section of the station is the Shipyard.  The Shipyard is a large, cylindrical, scaffold-esque tube which is connected to The Core at one end and open at the other.  The scaffold is 330 meters long and 60 meters in diameter.  The shipyard is made up of two sections: the manufacturing section and the assembly section.  The manufacturing section is used to physically construct spaceship parts, and the assembly section is where those parts are assembled into spacecraft.  Notably, this structure has four [!5 manipulator arms] used in ship construction.\n    In total, the station is 472 meters long and has a diameter of 60 meters (diameter discounting the gravity rings).  The Molokai Station is capable of building ships up to 200 meters long.\n    \n    Life on the station is dictated by the quality standards of Exospace, the living standards are high but, but work standards set by the organization are strict, and have been reported to be unusually stressful to both higher managers and construction workers.",

Ferrotapes come in many shapes, sizes, and storage amounts, and have been invented independently on many worlds in ancient times.\n\n    Typically, Ferrotapes can store anywhere between 4 and 256 Kibibytes.  Tapes are able to be made at higher data densities, but higher densities of tape are found to be more prone to corruption or simple data rot.  Individual Ferrotapes have a read/write speed of ~4.2 Kibibytes per second.\n\n    The cases of Ferrotapes are most commonly metal, but are ocassionally made of other materials such as enamel or plastics.  Inside of this case is two (or more) spools holding the lengths of magnetic tape on which the tape's data is stored.\n\n   Accessing and manipulating the data is done using a piece of hardware called a Tape Reader, Tape Drive, or Ferrotape Drive.  In this drive is a small piece of hardware called a reader/writer head.  This head rests against part of the tape's case at which the tape is exposed.  The reader head can then read the data on that position of the tape, or write data to the tape in the form of magnetism, effectively reading or writing with the disk.  The Tape Drive selects which point on the tape its reading by rotating the tape's spools, which moves the length of tape.\n\n    There are many common dimensions for tape drives across the [!1 GCP].

The Tapedeck has a controller that manages every reader head within the Tapedeck, treating them as one large, singular data volume.  The number of Ferrotapes in a Tapedeck is usually a power of two (Ex: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32).\n\n    Tapedecks are able to attain read/write speeds several times that of an individual Ferrotape.  This is because Tapedecks spread their data across all of the tapes within them.  The Tapedeck makes use of this because it means it will take a fraction of the time to read/write every individual byte.  For example, if a Tapedeck has 4 Ferrotapes in its array, it will access data 4 times faster (16.8KiB/s) faster than an individual tape (4.2KiB/s).  Usually, all the tapes within a Tapedeck need to be the same storage size.\n\n    There are two configurations of Tapedeck: Swappable and Non-Swappable.  Non-Swappable Tapedecks have cases that are not intended to be opened, and are not made to be maintained.  Swappable Tapedecks are able to be opened, and have the individual tapes within them replaced.  Though, before removing a tape from the array, it's suggested that a user \"reshuffles\" the data on the Tapedeck to render the soon-to-be-removed tape unused.  The user can then safely remove the tape from the deck.  If the user then replaces the tape with another, the user should then \"reshuffle\" the data in the deck again to make use of the new tape.\n\n    Some Tapedecks are made with a \"multidrive\" setting, where the Tapedeck can dynamically make multiple logical data volumes out of specific tapes, up to the number of tapes in the deck.  This is also achievable by special software.",

In the years 10 to 12, the planet was terraformed via Seed Shell Bombardment, covering the planet with green flora. \n\n    The red surface is mainly composed of mountains, valleys, and gigantic continental plateaus.  Surprisingly, Ice is found on the highest mountain caps of the moon, despite with the relative warmth of the planet.\n\n    Towns and places established after the year 62 have been constructed and placed underground.  This is for two reasons: allowing for the exposed land to be used for farmland, and making Urran homes and buildings more difficult to invade.

Habiuetine was branded as Cisvatic in the year 70, after lengthy medical trials beginning in 65 which concluded that Habiuetine was a safe treatment for many long-term stress disorders.  However, after the regulation of Habiuetine as Cisvatic, the potency of branded Habiuetine was decreased dramatically and black market dealers began to profit on the success of their new highly addictive street drug [!4 Spirit Honey].\n\n    Habiuetine's raw materials can be found on most planets naturally, and is manufactured using chemical synthesis.  Habiuetine should not be combined with other depressants.\u0000css\n    Habiuetine, in its pure form, is a known depressant used to soothe stress, anxiety, depression, and some eating disorders.  Side effects of Habiuetine may include drowsiness, loss of appetite, and minor loss of motor control.  Symptoms of withdrawal from Habiuetine have been observed to occur after halting intake of the substance after a one month period of constant use.  The withdrawal symptoms (at this level) have not been shown to be fatal.  However, 1 in 10 users of Habiuetine who did not experience a stress disorder before taking Habiuetine developed a trauma-related stress disorder after sudden discontinuation of the substance.\n\n    The signs of a moderate overdose cannot be detected until at least 14 hours after the intake of 24mg per kilogram of the user's mass.  A moderate overdose is physically unpleasant, with the first symptom to occur being a large, dry, flaky, and itchy rash on limbs, which will progress to dizziness followed by fainting.  The psychological effects of an overdose will leave a user feeling euphoric and impulsive, yet further use of Habiuetine before it has cleared a user's system could lead to a fatal overdose.\n    The fatal dose of Habiuetine is around 60mg, and can be detected very soon after ingestion.  The user's perceived euphoria becomes overpowering, there is a slow onset of complete numbness, complete loss of motor control, and, if a rash is present from the moderate overdose, it will begin to blister.  There are only preventative actions to be taken against a fatal overdose, otherwise, death is imminent within 14 hours.  The user, after a fatal overdose, will likely encounter seizures and finally succumb to cardiac toxicity.",

The [!3 Interstellar Psychiatric Cooperative] decreases the potency of Habiuetine using humidity chambers in order to make Cisvatic safe for the general public; the effects of Cisvatic are about 2/3 the strength of that of its pure active ingredient.  Cisvatic is commonly used to treat long-term stress disorders.  Commonly, it's known to have a soothing affect on its users, and is usually prescribed to be administered as needed, although a user is advised not to ingest more than three doses within a 20 hour period.  Cisvatic may cause drowsiness.\n\n    Cisvatic is ingested in small gel capsules with liquid centers which are intended to be swallowed whole.  The gel capsules come in red and are printed with the label \"ICP-CIS\" in white.  A prescription bottle of Cisvatic contains, on average, 30 capsules.",

While users have noted the “pure bliss” of Spirit Honey use, most active users have been assessed to be ignorant of the observable physical consequences, as though there is a complete lack of pain and awareness of the substance's side effects.  Side effects of Spirit Honey are not fully understood as there has been no user to survive long term use, and clinical human trials are decidedly unethical.  Short-term side effects include a rash, slowed heart rate, and delirium.\n    \n    Spirit Honey is a gold-colored, translucent fluid.  In the 80s, it was discovered to be florescent, glowing under blacklight.  This has led to Spirit Honey vendors affixing blacklights in locations where Spirit Honey is consumed for aesthetic purposes.\u0000css\n\n    Spirit Honey is not commonly sold in a package.  Instead, dealers who synthesize the illegal substance commonly organize small gatherings where the substance is boiled and poured into a communal bowl.  This gathering is usually held in a small room to contain the fumes of the boiling Spirit Honey, which are said to give a temporary ego death, making the user feel a sense of \"total connection to the universe\".  After the fumes are inhaled, the bowl is passed around and sipped from.  Spirit Honey has been found to be more popular on planets with lower GDPs.",

Delavium is meant to be used strictly during surgeries where a patient is required to be unconscious, and is not intended as a sedative for general use.  Delavium renders the patient unconscious within moments, and the patient will remain unconscious for 12-16 hours.  The addictivity of Dalavium is low to moderate, making it an appealing option for use on patients who have a history of addictive tendencies, and those who are prone to addiction.  Upon waking up after surgery, the potential side effects of Delavium include weakness, numbness, pain relief, and disorientation.\n\n    Delavium is packaged in large pressurized containers labeled with \"BlueStone Medicine\".  On the flat bottom of the pressurized container, there is white print reading \"DEL-BSM\".  One canister of Delavium contains 20 400-miligram doses.  Delavium is inhaled by a user by wearing a medical breathing mask.  Application of Delavium should be handled by a professional.",

The sub-gallean structures create a facinating Violet glow through the ice; the city within has a reputation for its red lights.  The city of Heralius is one of the oldest known settlements on Gallea, with ancient fortifications circling around it in layers.  These layers are standing evidence of how far the settlement has grown since its origin.  In the center of the city, on the surface, a line of buildings can be seen high above the others on a rocky ridge.  This ridge is where the oldest buildings in the city, as well as government offices, are located.  It was founded by the influential Heral tribe around a now-dormant volcano in the center of the ridge.\n\n    The most notable areas in the city are the Government and Historic Districts, both having equally-artistic designs consisting of perma-ice, rock, and metals.  In the Ancient district, high on the ridge, are the original buildings made of perma-ice, and the ancient grand hall of the Heral tribe.  In the Government district, a massive complex of buildings extends from deep in the icy crust to high in the Gallean sky.  The Government Disctrict has a local garrison of the Gallean Army patrolling the large halls, as well as a small array of military spaceships that are ready to launch at a moment's notice.  The industrial sectors across the city are primarily underground in order to have their heat absorbed back into the planet, with high smokestacks penetrating the surface and high into the sky to release greenhouse gases.  The majority of the city's power is produced through Nuclear Fission in these industrial sectors.\u0000css\n    The city has changed hands many times in previous eras of [!1 Gallean history], and a keen observer can spot unpatched bullet holes and craters in the older and less-maintained sections of the city.  In fact, some irreversibly-damaged buildings from past wars have been built around inside the bases of newer buildings to preserve them to be examined by future generations.\n\n    The city's public transit system includes a complex of underground tunnels with [!2 maglev] trains traversing the city at high speeds.  These trains end or start their daily routes at the Central Station, underneath the Historic District, where trains and transports from across the planet’s surface depart and arrive constantly.  Above the ground, [!3 airships] directed by suspended guide rails ferry passengers, with [!3 skydocks] built into the sides of almost every highrise.  In the outskirts of the town, primitive land crafts and [!4 cars] travel on aging permafrost roads.  Typically, these vehicles are found in the industrial slums.\n\n    Being the capital of the [!5 Gallean State], the city has a hybrid military-civilian law enforcement system.  This system has been credited as the reason for the city's commonly-low crime rate.  However, as the red lights of the inner city fade into the orange of the industrial slums, the rule of law tends to lose its influence.  These areas have been nicknamed the Slumrals, and their residents, the Slumrats.",

The government has 3 major branches, The Workers council, The Military Council, & The Tribunal of workers.  Under the Gallea's Constitution each has its own separate powers: The Military Council has full control of military affairs; the Workers Council is a massive elected body of millions of citizens which decides civil laws or legislation as well as governance; the Tribunal is the central body, elected in a mass election, it has powers to settle disputes between both the Military Council and Worker's Council, and foreign and domestic affairs.\n    \n    Political parties on Gallea, more accurately called 'Unions', are the center of the political system.  These unions can be formed at any time by anyone, and are voted into existence by electoral districts for the council.  The same electoral districts determine which union of an area wins a specific vote.  The winning union then places some of its members into the won seats, traditionally into seats that represent home districts of the appointed member.  The Tribunal, however, is a winner-takes-all election, which does not follow district divisions and only votes by individual Gallean citizens in regards to voting people into power.  The chosen union then appoints members into the tribunal, with the Head Justice elected by the appointed members.\u0000css\n    The Tribunal of Workers is voted in by the public vote, with a head justice chosen by the members of the political union that won the last Tribunal Election, acting as head of state.  This branch has the most influential powers of the 3, having the ability to declare war, set domestic & foreign policy, sign treaties, take executive action, declare martial law in times of war or disaster.  The Tribunal also holds the impressive power to dissolve either the Worker's Council or Military Council, given a vote to do so passes in the Worker's Council.  The main duty of the Tribunal is to manage the national court system, and the judgment of national laws and military action.\n\n     At 564 million members, the Worker’s Council is voted in by local district councils of workers, separated into mostly-equal districts of 10 million people each throughout the nation.  The powers of this branch are; to write and vote laws into effect; veto decisions of the Tribunal; set the taxes and budget for all of the government (if a budget proposition fails to be agreed, on the previous year’s agreed budget will be used in its place).; set the naturalization process for immigrants; and agree on the mandate of any national expansion.\n\n    The Military Council is led by the High Admiral and High General of the [!1 navy(fleet)] and army respectively.  They are largely autonomous, but can be made subservient to the Tribunal.  The military has control over all military matters; the constitution leaves the military council’s role intentionally vague to be interpreted as needed.",

It's a hot world, with the poles sitting at about -32°C on average, and the equator usually reaching up to 40°C.  From space, Osirja is a rough ball of tan-brown sand and soil, with small, white ice caps on either pole.  Near the equator are two small freshwater lakes, both of which harboring small towns. \n\n    Osirja, since its colonization, has become a major economic hub of [!2 Bius Tu] and the GCP as a whole.  One by one, many large businesses have created offices and manufacturies there, which in turn, added a drive for more internal infrastructure on the planet, which only boosted the planet's economy further.  Most of the planet's business takes place in [!3 Liveston City], the capital of the planet.  There are other population centers on the planet, but they are dwarfed by Liveston in population, physical size, and economy.\u0000css\n    The majority of Osirja's surface around the equator is dirty deserts.  These deserts are largely infertile when untreated, and are commonly featureless save for hills and rifts in the earth.  These deserts are very sparsely populated by hardy plants of various [!4 vivotypes], whose seeds were brought by early colonists.  While the planet's flora may be sparse, it's fauna is even sparser; most wildlife can only be found in or around human population centers, living off the scraps and waste produced by the planet's inhabitants.\n    \n    Though Osirja has a sizable amount of water, most of it is locked into the planet's ice caps without very much water circulating in the rain cycle.  Osirja wasn't always this way, though; before any human contact, virtually all of the planet's water was frozen in its poles.  But over the years of Osirja's inhabitance, the global temperature has raised by a few degrees, which has melted some of the material of the ice caps.  In fact, the planet's lakes hadn't appeared until after human inhabitance had started.",

They assessed that the planet's temperature was adequate, but its atmospheric pressure and gravity where nominal at best, and with the high concentration of carbon dioxide, the air was unbreathable.\n    \n    Later, in 31, with the data gathered by the Deorian crew, a landing party was sent by [!2 Bius tu] to gather more data.  The mission consisted of a lander with an away team of four, and a warp-capable orbiter with a crew of five.  The away team stayed on the surface for 56 hours, measuring the planet's mostly-carbon-dioxide atmosphere and soil to determine which sort of plant(s) would be needed to make the atmosphere breathable.  The team then returned with their data.\n    \n    After contracting with the [!3 Transition Genetics] company, the Tuine team returned in 34 with a fleet of three [!4 spaceplanes].  Each of these planes' cargo bays was full of seed vials for a proprietary species of plant designed by Transition Genetics.  These seeds were sprinkled everywhere across the surface of the planet.  A team of three was sent down in a habitation module, intended to stay there for just over half of a [!5 galactic year] to monitor the status of the new vegetation as it grows and prepare for landings of future colonists.  This landing site's name, when translated from [!6 Tuine] to [!7 Unil], meant \"Osirja Prime\".\n    \n    In the year 41, the atmosphere had built up enough oxygen to be considered survivable.  After this, more habitation modules were sent down to Osirja Prime, each containing more colonists and more basic supplies.  From there, construction began on proper [!8 rocket fields] and the first permanent structures.  Using their supplies, they treated some of the ground around their encampment with nutrients to allow them to start cultivating crops.\u0000css\n    With promises of a new world to live on, colonists arrived in the hundreds through the years 42 to 49 as Osirja Prime expanded, bringing the population of the body to over 1,000.  In the midst of the [!9 Space Bubble], larger corporations began to see Osirja as more than just a backwater colony; given its opportune position in the middle of common [!10 GCP] space, the planet was (and still is) very valuable real estate.  One by one, companies started buying space to build offices, factories, and depots.\n    \n    From the years 52 to 93, Osirja's population extended greatly, transitioning from a mere colony to a full-on populated world.  In 57, the population surpassed one million, and the planet was ratified as its own province within the [!11 Tuine Government] (as opposed to still being considered a part of homeworld Bius Tu's provincial government).  On the 5th of Bloom, year 58, Osirja Prime was renamed to [!12 Liveston City] and crowned as the planet's capital city.",

Historians have determined that this chant originated from [!2 Itascus] during the [!3 Itascan World War].  Though, whether this chant was created by soldiers, or just by higher-ups for morale purposes is unknown.  While this chant is not the only marching chant to come from Itascus, it is the most broadly popular.\n    \n    \n    The modern chant goes as follows:\n    \n    \"→\" denotes a skipped beat\n    \"-\" denotes a word being spread over multiple beats.  (By default, each word is one beat)\n    \"A123\" is the singers' [!4 Platoon Tag], which, in this example is \"A123\"\n    Lines beginning with \"C: \" are sung by the marching leader.  Lines beginning with \"B: \" are sung by the rest of the marchers.\n    The number in parenthesis at the end of the line indicates how many steps (in the march) that line is spread over.\n    \n    C: [So] the days are long and nights are cold. (8)\n    \n    B: → The days are long and nights are cold. (8)\n    \n    C: [But] they can't take the fire from our souls. (8)\n\n    B: They can't take fire from our souls.

Though, the section adding the planet's abbreviation only started appearing in the 40s.  The \"Indigo Terra\" section is most commonly sung by members of the Itascan Space Fleet.  This is because national Itascans did not start culturally identifying with their planet until -after- their world war.  Originally, that section was something akin to the following:\n    \n    C: E- → cho → (4)\n\n    B: One two three → (4)\n    \n    C: E- → cho → (4)\n    \n    B: A B C → (4)",

We use degrees instead of a unit of measurement for distance because it remains consistent regardless of the planetoid's size.\n\n    For any given point on a planet's surface, its Latitude describes its position along the planet's axis of rotation(north/south), while its Longitude describes its position perpendicular to the planet's axis of rotation(east/west).\n\n    Latitude is denoted by a number ranging from 0 to 180, with 0 being a planet's South Pole, and 180 being the planet's north pole.  A point having a latitude of 90 would mean that it is on the planet's equator.  This measurement only goes from 0 to 180 (as opposed to 360) because it only describes a point's position \"up and down\", and not all the way around.\n\n    Longitude is denoted by a number ranging from 0 to 360.  Since no point on a planet's surface can inherently, definitively be the 'start' of a planet's land.  Thus, a point on the surface is arbitrarily defined as the planet's 'longitudinal origin' by its inhabitants (or discoverers).  This origin marks which point, east to west, on the planet's surface is longitude 0.  If you were to go west from this point, your longitude would underflow and loop back over to 360 (since the planet is a sphere).  If you were to go east, your longitude value would increase more the further east you go.  If you were at a longitude of 180, it would mean that you're on the side of the planet opposite of the planet's Longitudinal Origin.",

They originated in the great plains of La`Foy, and were the most complicated culture of their time.  Because if this, they played a large part in [!2 La`Foyan History].\n    \n    Based on recovered records from that era etched in stone, it is believed that Proto Ruitai had a very poor understanding of disease.  By noticing that larger villages were more likely to be wiped out by disease, they erroneously concluded that sufficiently-large collections of people were cursed, and doomed to die mysteriously.  This number was decided to be exactly 81; they believed that a population of this number or greater in a village would cause the population to die suddenly and mysteriously.  In fact, the ancient Nunwei word for plague, \"Sabisa\", directly translates to '81' in [!3 Nunwei].\n    \n    Village-wiping diseases were seen as curses of pure evil, and something to be avoided at all costs. Because of this, sufficiently-large villages would split in two, with one half staying and the other leaving to create a new village, likely never seeing their original village again.  Because of this phenomenon, complex La`Foyan culture was able to more-easily spread across the planet.\u0000css\n     As the Proto Ruitai encountered outsiders as they spread, they would commonly observe that the outsiders' villages had populations exceeding 81.  In these cases, the Proto Ruitai tribe would avoid the outsider tribe altogether, or attempt to fix the population of offending village themselves.  In the case of the latter, the Proto Ruitai tribe may attempt to communicate with the foreign village.  Though, this approach rarely worked, as the other tribe would have either a vastly-different language, or no proper language at all.\n    In other cases, special warriors known as Sabisari would raid the offending village, killing members of the tribe at random to decrease the population to a suitable level.  These warrior would wield axe-like weapons called [!4 Sifaku] on these raids.  Written records from that era indicate that they had thought that this act helped the villages, while in reality, this likely only crippled the communities.",

Originally, the weapon was made of the sharpened shoulder blades of large animals, but in more recent times, it has been made of composite materials or metal.  The weapon, in total, is usually 1.4 meters long, with the blade taking up anywhere from 1/3 to 1/2 of the length.  The stick of the Sifaku, called the 'shaft', is bent at the middle at a 20° angle.  At the very end of the shaft, opposite of the blade is a strap or short length of rope.  In total, this weapon can cost anywhere between $55 and $120.\n    \n    The user is intended to hold the base of the upper half of the shaft, just above the bend in the wood.  They are then supposed to attach the strap/twine to the back of their lower arm.  This is done to keep strikes powerful and to prevent disarmament.  When taken into combat, a user typically wields two Sifaku. \n\n    This weapon was developed as a tool by the ancient [!1 La'Foyan] [!2 Proto Ruitai] people.  Originally, the Sifaku was used to fell trees in the forests of [!3 La'Foy].  Though, it was found to be an effective weapon, and was used as such by ancient La'Foyans.",

She was very in-touch with the [!5 Surari] of the region she lived in, and pioneered [!6 Surari-Human relations].  Some historians postulate that Ama had actually made up her own name, because she may have forgotten the name given to her by her birth parents. \n\n    Most written records, as folklore surrounding her, state that Ama was actually raised by Surari.  According to Ama herself, she separated from her biological parents at the age of five [!7 local years] (~5.55 [!8 Galactic Years]).  She was allegedly then discovered by a family of Surari, which had raised her from that point.  At the age of 10 local years (~11.1 Galactic Years) she reestablished contact with the local villages of humans.  Popular folklore says that Ama was trying to find her birth parents, but this is not definitive.\u0000css\n    All surviving reports describing Ama's personality concur that she was perceived to be very strange by the humans she interacted with.  She was reluctant to eat prepared food, would refuse to wear garments, expressed discomfort entering buildings, and hated being touched.\n    Her understanding of the local human language, [!4 Nunwei], was rudimentary, leading to difficulty expressing herself to other humans.  While speaking, she would sometimes use chatters or yips in the place of words; these vocalizations were believed to be [!5 Surariwei signals].  Unsurprisingly, her stature was described as being very Surari-like.\n\n    Ama's Surari family began drifting further from her local village at the age of around 11 local years (~12.22 Galactic Years).  Locals attempted to convince her to stay with other humans, but she was adamant that she had to stay with her family of Surari, and that being with other humans was undesirable.  After that point, she was never seen again.  She is believed to have died as she lived: among the Surari of the Bingko woods.\n    \n    Ama was crowned as a [!1 Kianrui] centuries after her death; Surari taming had changed the course of [!9 La'Foyan history], and La'Foyan culture honored her for the advancements she pioneered.  In fact, the Nunwei word for riding a mount, \"Janu\", is derived from her name.  \"Ama\" later became a popular name on La'Foy starting in the -1,800s.",

From feet to the top of the head, Surari are 2.2 meters tall, with their ears extending up to another 30 centimeters from their heads.  Surari are almost 3 meters long from snout to flank, with their tails being anywhere from 0.2 to 0.8 meters; the dimensions of a Surari's tail can vary greatly depending on its place of origin.\n    The body of the Surari is covered almost exclusively in a modest pelt of fur, which is thinner on the face and feet.  The pelt's palette can vary based on the location the Surari is found in, usually being a shade of brown, orange, or amber.  Some specimens, found in cooler, polar climates, have light grey, or even stark-white coats.\u0000css\n    The face of a Surari closely resembles that of its human cousin species, the [!2 La'Foyan Race], though the face of the Surari is much broader and longer; their snouts are long, jutting out around 35 centimeters from the face.  Their muzzles are well-defined, being almost flat on the top and bottom, with the muzzle itself being 16 centimeters wide at the end and about 20 centimeters wide at the base.  This large oral structure is attributed to being related to the Surari's instinctive hunting style: latching onto sizable pray with their large maws and sharp teeth to keep their meals from escaping.  Despite the similarity to their sapient cousins, Surari do not have dark patches of fur around their eyes.\n\n    Surari are remarkably cognizant for their kind, almost having a general intelligence.  The word for a collection or pack of Surari is a \"family\", as in \"a family of Surari\".  Wild Surari live in packs of five to forty.  Because of this, Surari are very social creatures; studies have shown that Surari are [!3 Faciocentric], being able to recognize and remember the faces of other Surari and La'Foyans alike, attaching unique perceived personalities to each face in their minds.  Surari families are alloparental, meaning that the matured members of a pack collectively care and provide for all the young of the family, regardless of if a specific Tira (word for preadult Surari) is the direct offspring of the adult providing care.\u0000css\n    Surari have shown to be capable of very simple learned language skills; Surari have been observed in the wild to emit howl-like vocalizations for communication, which can be intelligibly heard from up to 8 kilometers away.  The cadence, pitch, and frequency of these howl patterns determine their meanings.  Interestingly, these specific howl patterns are not sourced from the being's instincts, and are in fact learned from other beings around them (almost exclusively other Surari).  Each family of Surari has been found to have a specific \"family call\", which is a howl pattern specific to an individual family used to rally the pack or locate lost members.  As well as howls, some arrangements of short yips or chatters can be made to have vague meaning, used when Surari are communicating face to face.  These chatter-yips are usually relegated to more \"interpersonal\" communications, such as expressing hunger, a request for a mate, expressing fatigue, or other short-range exchanges of information.\n    A region can have its own unique \"Surari language\", with specific, unique howl and chatter patters associated with useful exchanges of information such as alerting others of threats, informing others of nearby prey, and other useful details.  The word for a Surari regional language is \"Surariwei\", and a unique vocalization carrying a specific meaning is called a \"ra'weic\" or \"signal\".\n\n    A common Surari is hostile to most all beings encountered that are smaller than it; Surari hunt and eat practically any creature they can take down.  Though, surprisingly, hostility from Surari towards La'Foyans (or other species closely related to La'Foyans) is remarkably uncommon.  This is accredited to the Surari's facial recognition capabilities mentioned previously.  This phenomenon extends to non-La'Foyan species of human, but usually to a lesser extent.\u0000css\nSurari have two documented physical sexes: \"male\" and \"female\".  The dimensions of a Surari's tail are correlated to the creature's physical sex, and are the only outwardly-observable divergent feature of the species' sexual polymorphism.  Females' tails are large, round, and bulbous, being teardrop-shaped at around 0.7 meters long and around half a meter in diameter.  The ends of females' tails, about the last 20 centimeters, are a different color than the rest of the Surari's body, being a shade lighter or darker.  The tail of a common male Surari, on the other hand, is long and shaggy, being up to a meter long and of uniform color (the same color as the rest of the creature's pelt).  The hairs on the bottom of a male's tail look comparatively emaciated, flaying out underneath.\n\n    Surari and human La'Foyans have had a very productive relationship.  In fact, the [!4 relations between La'Foyans and their Surari] have been very impactful, even measurably effecting the course of [!5 La'Foyan Natural History].",

Many ancient La'Foyans, those who lived on [!2 La'Foy] before the year -2,800 P.W., believed Surari to be another, simpler type of human -- another subrace of La'Foyan.  This is thought to be due to the similar facial structure between the La'Foyans and Surari, rendering Surari easily anthropomorphized by the La'Foyan People.  In fact, the word \"Surari\" is derived from the La'Foyan words for \"person\" and \"beast\".\n    \n    In ancient times, interactions between [!3 Proto Ruitai] tribes and families of Surari were largely uneventful.  Though, some fossil records recovered on the borders of the La'Foyan Great Plains and the Bingko Forests illustrate families of Surari slain with human tools, and tribes of La'Foyans raided and killed by Surari jaws.  But, these violent interactions were rare; the Surari were not vilified, and they continued to live in relative peace.\n    \n    La'Foyan folklore contains countless stories of human children wandering off from their villages only to be taken in by families of Surari.  But, these instances were, and still are, incredibly rare.  On the other side of the coin, there are reports of lone young Surari encountering Proto Ruitai villages and being allowed in to live their lives as little more than pets among the village humans.\n    \n    In the -2,800s, new Surari-human interactions were pioneered by one of the first La'Foyan [!4 Kianrui], [!5 Ama Januko].  Ama was a La'Foyan of the Bingko forest, said to have been raised by Surari.  Ama taught the people of the Bingko forest how to make Surari more comfortable with human presence.  Surari of the region became closer to humans, leading to more symbiotic relationships.  Specifically, ancient La'Foyans' problem solving skills synergized well with the speed and strength and the Surari, making them very desirable hunting partners.\u0000css\n    Ama later taught the Bingko people how to ride Surari, which proved to be quick mounts; Surari were, and still are, able to move much faster than a standard human.  Surari riders, known as Januri, took their new knowledge of Surari with them as they traveled.  Though it was still remarkably difficult, knowledge of Surari taming and riding spread from the Bingko Forests to the La'Foyan Great Plains and Biu'ngan Swamps.  This new knowledge was quickly instilled into the tribes of these areas.\n    \n    Surari became parts of the lives of ancient La'Foyans all across the planet over the next century.  At this point, many tribes began to see Surari as sources of utility.  Surari were gradually used for more applications; breeds of Surari were eventually made to fill the purposes of faster mounts, pets, and even beasts of burden.  Docility and lethargy was bred into many of the breeds of Surari we now know today, making them more dependent on their human caretakers.",

        "data": "css\n    Retroskip Pitching is an audio data manipulation method used to digitally raise the pitch of an audio stream while preserving its duration.  Retroskip Pitching is a very computationally-simple process, meaning that it takes very little processing time to perform, so little that it can even be done in real time to live audio streams.  But, this pitching process can audibly distort sound through raising the pitch.  It's very easy to discern, by audio alone, if a track has been Retroskip Pitched.  This is because Retroskip Pitching is not a lossless process, meaning that some audio fidelity and definition is lost through using it.\n\n    Retroskip Pitching is actually a name used to describe a two similar processes: \"Skip Pitching\" and \"Retrograde Pitching\".  Both of these methods use many of the same fundamental functions.  In Retroskip Pitching programs, there are two primary parameters used to define how the audio should be changed: the \"Sample Interval\" and the \"Sample Repeat\".\u0000css\n    When audio is run through a retroskip pitching program, the track is first cut into numerous smaller samples based on the Sample Interval parameter.  For example: if the track is 10 seconds (10,000 milliseconds) long, and the Sample Interval is set to 0.25 seconds (250 milliseconds), the program will divide the track into 40 quarter-second samples (because 10 divided by 0.25 is 40).  After the track is divided into samples, the program then compresses the length of each sample to be shorter than it was originally.  This part of the process references the Sample Repeat parameter.  Specifically, the program shortens the sample by a factor of Sample Repeat.  For example: if Sample Repeat is set to 4, the sample will be sped up to be 4 times shorter than -- one fourth the duration of -- the original sample.  After this, the sample is then repeated the same number of times as the factor it was shortened by in order to be the same total length as the original sample (ex: if the sample was made 4 times shorter, it would be repeated 4 times).  If the process is Retrograde Pitching, every other repeated sample would be played in reverse.  Some think that reversing every other sample creates a slightly \"smoother\" sound.  If the process is simply Skip Pitching, none of the samples are reversed.\u0000css\n    Finally, the process joins all the samples together in their original order, which creates the final audio stream.  The final audio stream is the same length as the original, but has been altered to be a higher pitch.\n\n    Retroskip Pitching is an ancient method of audio manipulation, having been independently invented on many worlds prior to the invention of [!1 Warp Drive].  It has since been made obsolete for its intended purpose by other, less lossful methods of modulating pitch, such as Frequency Isolation.  Though, Retroskip Pitching is still in wide use in modern times, either for vanity reasons, for reasons of real-time pitch modulation, or for setups with limited computer resources.  Some manipulate the settings of Retroskip programs in certain ways to make songs sound remarkably different in a method called [!2 Skipjacking].\n\n    When used on live audio streams, Retroskip Pitching is latent by one Sample Interval.  This is because these programs require a sample to be recorded before it is repeated.",

Skipjacking is sometimes applied to a person's voice in media (to make it appear alien or robotic), but is mainly used in music of the [!2 Echobeat] genre.\n\n    Skipjacking is simply the intentional misconfiguration of a [!1 Retroskip Pitching] program.  Specifically, in Skipjacking, the program's Sample Interval is set to a comparatively-long period (upwards of 100 miliseconds).  This creates a distinguishable \"skipping\" effect in the audio, because the Sample Interval has been made long enough that listeners can audibly discern the looping of the sound.\n\n    Some Retroskip Pitching programs themselves have been modified into programs made specifically for Skipjacking.  These programs can be made to make the Sample Interval and Sample Repeat parameters change midway through a track (usually in an [!2 Echobeat] song).  This can be done to give a section of a track audible emphasis, or to change certain parts of songs.\n    Skipjacking Programs are commonly made to \"miss\", as in refraining from repeating, certain sections of the track at a regular interval.  This feature is usually intended to allow an operator to align the \"Miss Interval\" with a song's downbeat, which helps to preserve the rhythm.  This is so the \"beat\" in a song won't be skipped.\n\n    In Skipjacking, a song or instrument's Sample Repeat may also be referred to as its \"microtempo\".  The reasoning behind this is that it's sort of a sub-beat, or \"the beat within a beat\".",

        "data": "css\n    Echobeat, sometimes called \"Doubletime\" or \"Retroskip Music\", is a style of music characterized by heavy use of [!1 Skipjacking], which is a method of audio manipulation derived from [!2 Retroskip Pitching].  Some consider Echobeat to be a musical genre of its own, but many musical professionals seem to agree that Echobeat is too broad to be labeled a genre, and that it would be more accurate to instead call it a 'style' of music.\n\n    Echobeat songs primarily feature intentionally-blatant artificially-raised-pitch audio.  Second to the pitch, a characteristic of Echobeat music is a \"glitchy\" aesthetic.  More specifically, Echobeat artists employ the ideas of malfunctioning audio hardware and corrupted sound data into their personas and bands.  Though, in reality, calling Echobeat music \"corrupted\" is a misnomer; the auditory effects present in said songs are intentional, and commonly require meticulous, precise work.\n    The most common audio manipulation process used in Echobeat music is intentionally misconfiguring [!2 Retroskip Pitching] programs, a practice known as [!1 Skipjacking].  The application of Skipjacking raises the pitch of a song's audio (while maintaining its tempo and time signature), but also creates an audible skipping effect.  The program is sometimes also configured to add random variations in a song's skipping pattern, giving it a more \"glitchy\" sound.\n    Skipjacking is applied, in this instance, by aligning the Skipjacking program's Sample Interval with the tempo of the song.  This makes the Skipjacking process synergize with a song's beat, and many Echobeat fanatics claim that this adds an interesting layer of complexity to the music.  This, combined with the song's raised pitch and datamusic-esque demeanor, has led to Echobeat music being very popular among niche groups of related interests.\u0000css\n    The majority of Echobeat music, upwards of 65% of all tracks, is in the form of edits of pre-existing songs.  Tracks such as these are more akin to remixes; artists of these tracks take a pre-existing digital recording of a song (typically one from [!3 popular culture]), and fine-tune their Skipjacking software to perfectly align with its beat.  The artist may then make additional changes to the track to enhance the listening experience and/or further differentiate it from its source material.  The final result is a song that is of the Echobeat style of music, but the song it is mixed from is still recognizable.  Tracks such as these are popular in small pockets across the [!4 Silver Stream], and on numerous small gatherings on [!5 the Internet].\n\n    The rest of Echobeat music consists of original songs explicitly composed in the Echobeat style.  Entirely-originally-produced Echobeat music has some perks over Echobeat music produced through remixing.  For example, an original artist would have all the stems (individual instruments and vocals) of their song.  With these, an artist could apply Skipjacking to every element of the song individually (or apply no skipping on certain elements entirely).  This means that the individual instrumentals (and vocals) of many originally-composed Echobeat songs are differentially-skipped.  This can add another layer of complexity to a track, as the different Sample Intervals (meaning different microtempos) of the stems can be made to align and synergize with one another.\u0000css\n    Echobeat music first arose on [!6 Erii] in the 43rd [!7 Galactic Year].  It was originally produced by a duo band of musicians which was named \"Doubletime\".  Originally, Echobeat music was simply called \"Retroskip Music\", named after the audio manipulation method its made with, [!8 Retroskip Pitching].  On Erii, Echobeat music experienced some minor popularity, but its scene could have been described as \"underground\".  Doubletime released two albums and went on tour across Erii before disbanding in the year 47.  After that point, Echobeat largely faded into obscurity.  Some time in the 60s, while the majority of this style of music was being produced through remixes (meaning few original songs), the style took on the name \"Echobeat\".\n    On the 3rd of Bloom, year 78, [!9 Data 4] appeared, a [!10 Deorian] band of four with a passion for Echobeat music.  In total, they produced three albums, had four tours, graced Deoria's Top 8 lists five times.  This band believed to be what let Echobeat peek into the mainstream, instilling it into popular culture.  Data 4 disbanded and retired in 85.  In 96, [!11 The Echo Dolls], an [!12 Armalite] Trio, released their first album.  They aren't incredibly popular; most communities on some planets haven't even heard of them.  But, they are very popular in some places on the [!5 Galactic Internet], with devoted fans of theirs making pilgrimages to Armalai to hear their live shows.  As of today, The Echo Dolls are still an active band.\n\n    Despite being heavily reliant on digital manipulation, Echobeat music is actually able to be played live.  Though, this is not without its hurdles; there are many challenges that can deter live musicians from preforming Echobeat songs, such as the inherent delay of [!2 Retroskip Pitching], the disconnect between an artist's raw voice and the musical vocals, and difficulty for new Echobeat musicians to adequately hit their notes (due to the disconnect).\u0000css\n    To remedy this, many musicians instead opt not to listen to the live Echobeat music they're playing.  Instead, they use personal audio devices (such as headphones) to listen to the raw, unprocessed sounds of the instruments and vocals making up the song.  However, many artists disapprove of this method; some musicians insist that this method is lacking, and keeps someone from truly connecting to the music they're making.\n    \n    A few performers, called \"Echobeat Purists\", have made adaptations (or just simply trained long enough) to be able to listen to their music whilst playing it.  Some performers have trained for long enough that they can keep proper time and tune, even while listening to a delayed, filtered version of one's own sound.  This has some benefits over listening to one's own raw audio (as opposed to not listening to the final audio).  For instance, performers who actively listen to the same audio stream their audience is hearing can better make adjustments to their live performance; they can detect and fix problems that arise from things such as becoming out-of-beat with their Skipjacking program's Sample Interval.\n    \n    When performing Echobeat music live, its very important that an artist's tempo stays the same as that of the Skipjacking program they're running their audio through.  This is important because, if a song's downbeat drifts from the Skipjacking program's [!1 Miss Interval] (an interval that's intended to be aligned with a song's beat to preserve the rhythm), it can make the song sound truly, directionlessly, corrupted and distorted (which, many agree, makes the song much less appealing).  In Echobeat terminology, becoming misaligned with the Sample Interval is called \"Going lame\", ex: \"I think you're percussion is going lame every time we get like two minutes in\".\u0000css\n    There are many solutions to this problem.  For instance, a band may opt to have a metronome playing in their headphones.  Though, if the band is of Echobeat Purists (meaning they likely prefer not to wear headphones while performing), they may instead only have one member (usually the percussion musician) wear headphones with a metronome, with the other musicians of the band trained to follow that person's beat.  The band could also opt to just automate the process, and employ a [!13 computer] to produce a beat at a steady, unchanging interval.\n    There is another method of keeping time, known as \"Beat Flashing\", that doesn't make use of sound for maintaining the tempo.  Instead, the artists train to follow the beat of a light that flashes at a set interval.  This light may only be seen by the performers, or it may be incorporated into the audiovisual display of a show to enhance an audience's experience.",

        "data": "css\n    Qi-Induced Microstructuring, or just Qi Microstructuring (abbreviated as \"QIMS\" and commonly pronounced as \"chims\" by professionals), is a method of changing the microscopic crystal lattice of a crystal (commonly a type of quartz).  QIMS technology is used in everything from [!1 computer memory], to [!2 laser weapons], to sensors, to [!3 solar cells].\n\n    QIMS technology was initially, independently discovered by the [!4 Tyventians] and [!5 Deorians] in ancient times.  In the 30s, proper studies were conducted regarding the exact functionality and uses of QIMS on [!6 Bius Tu].  From there, many discoveries were made regarding how Qi Microstructures function, and how to better apply them in technologies.\n\n    Creating a Qi-Microstructured crystal requires something called a Structure Seed.  This seed is the nucleation point for the growing microstructured crystal, and acts as a sort of \"template\" for the rest of the material in the crystal.  For instance, the microscopic structure of the Structure Seed is repeated and copied throughout the rest of the crystal as it grows, with the entirety of the final crystal being made up of repetitions of that tiny structure.  Note, crystals only form around seeds via repeating Microstructures if the environment they form in has a high amount of ambient [!7 Qi Energy].  If its environment does not have sufficiently-high amounts of Qi energy, the crystal will form into a standard, natural crystal lattice.\u0000css\n    Notably, Qi-Microstructuring a crystal (as opposed to letting it grow naturally) usually drastically reduces the tensile strength of the material.  This is because, in functional applications, the functionality of a Microstructured crystal holds priority over its structural integrity.  On the molecular level, this is because growing the crystals in unnatural patterns leads to fewer connections being made between the atoms in the material, which subsequently leads to a weaker material.  The amount by which the material's tensile strength is reduced can be anywhere from 0% to 90%.\n\n    Since Qi Microstructures determine the crystalline structure, they subsequently determine the overall shape of a formed crystal.  For manufacturing purposes, these crystals are made to be cubic.  If the crystals are cubic, its much easier to determine where a crystal should be cut.  This is because the microstructures within a cubic crystal are perfectly aligned in a three-dimensional grid, making them very easy to machine.  If a crystal that was intended to be cubic is warped, or is another shape entirely, it is an indicator that the microstructure was \"encoded\" incorrectly; if a microstructure is incorrectly encoded, then the best thing a manufacturer can do is scrap the crystal and reuse its material for a new crystal.\n    Most all crystals made for industrial or functional purposes are cubic, but crystals made for other implements can have other shapes.  For example, Microstructured crystals made for artistic applications can be made in many different intricate formations.  Crystals made for implements involving [!8 Qi Invocation] exist in a variety of unusual shapes, as these crystals are (usually) not intended to be machined or align with mechanical parts.\u0000css\n    A fully-formed plate of Qi-Microstructured crystal is known as a \"wafer\", and is usually cut to be very thin.  They made thin (between 20 to 40 micrometers) so that a wafer will contain only a small number of layers of the Microstructures within.  Though, many wafers are made thick enough that they contain multiple layers of Qi Structure.  This thickness is measured with a unit known as \"Structure Layer Count\", or \"SLC\".  Ex: if a wafer has an SLC measurement of two, it means that its thinnest dimension is wide enough to contain two layers of its Microstructure within.  Some Microstructures are designed in a way such that the crystal's material will easily sheer away, layer by layer.\n    \n    Some certain patters of Microstructures interact with [!7 Qi Energy] in useful ways.  For example, certain Microstructures, when fed Qi Energy, will emit light in a specific direction (based on its design).  A microstructure such as this is useful for creating laser [!9 beam emitters].\n    Most technologies that make use of Qi-Induced Microstructures require multiple layers of different wafers stacked on top of eachother.  Occasionally, the wafers are also cut into small slivers and layered on eachothers' sides, as well as being put in other strange arrangements.  Once the wafers that are meant to interact with each other are aligned with one another, the entire set is encased in a hard resin or enamel.  This is to increase the strength of the arrangement.  A collection of wafers bound to one another in a case of resin or enamel is called a \"cake\".\u0000css\n    There are many useful applications for Qi Microstructures.  For example, the [!9 beam emitters] of all modern, mass-produced [!2 laser weaponry] are made of Qi Microstructures.  Even in ancient times, Qi-Microstructured crystals were used in [!8 Qi Invocation](spellcasting) due to their ability to interact with [!10 Qi entities] when charged, which makes them perfect materials for fabricating [!11 wands] or other [!12 spellcasting tools].",

Most notably, QMRP technology is used in [!1 Drifsam Diversion Cannons].\n    \n    Specifically, Qi-Mediated Remote Pressure is a technology used to apply pressure to objects over an extended distance without direct physical contact.  At its most basic, a QMRP applicator can be pointed at any object or material, given power, and the object or material will be pushed away from the QMRP device in the direction its pointing.\n    \n    A QMRP applicator can be imagined as beam emitter, emitting a line in the direction it is pointing.  Any matter this beam hits, including scattered materials, normal objects, or even air, will be pushed away in the exact direction of the beam, regardless of distance.  Of course, the applicator is also pushed in the opposite direction with an amount of force equal to that applied to the target.\n    \n    QMRP applicators are made through [!2 Qi-Induced Microstructuring] of Potassium Dichromate Crystals, with the microstructured crystal having a Structure Layer Count of eleven.  This means that QMRP applicators are usually very thin, less than a centimeter in width.  The majority of QMRP applicators are made to be circular.\n    \n    The amount of force a QMRP applicator is capable of applying is directly proportional to its area.  This means that the wider an applicator is, the harder its able to push.  Due to this, different sizes of applicators have garnered different names.  An applicator less than a centimeter in diameter is referred to as a \"die\"; one greater than a centimeter, but lesser than six centimeters, in diameter is called a \"chip\"; one greater than six centimeters in diameter is called a \"plate\".\u0000css\n    Qi-Mediated Remote Pressure was first discovered on [!3 Deoria] in the -50s through [!2 microstructuring] discoveries.  Among these discoveries were [!5 Flow Crystals], whole, natural crystals constructed out of QMRP-applying microstructures.  Though, these crystals were used only as inefficient fans, and their full utility wouldn't be realized for decades.\n    \n    In the 30s, through [!2 microstructuring] advancements, Flow Crystals were being studied and refined.  At this point, Flow Crystals were being cut into Microstructure wafers with Structure Layer Counts of just one.  This low layer count made the applicators very weak, meaning that they could not push very hard.  At the time, the technology was called \"Flow Wafer\" technology, and dismissed as being nothing more than another technology to make fans.\n    \n    Through the 70s to the 80s the [!4 Vectorate company] performed further research and development on Flow Wafers.  They had realized the potential applications of QMRP technology in space.  They managed to evolve a breed of microstructured Potassium Dichromate Crystal to allow eleven layers of QMRP microstructure to \"shoot\" through each other, effectively making QMRP devices eleven times stronger.\n    This breakthrough made QMRP technology viable for use in [!1 Drifsam Diversion Cannons].  Shortly after its invention, the technology was licensed to the [!5 Itascan Government] for cleaning up the aftermath of the [!6 Apocalypse Collision Incident].",

This tends to occur over an extended period of time, and generally in locations with high Qi concentration. Somehow, a Structure Seed or something similar had found its way into an organism’s internal ecosystem. Over a period of time, the bio-crystal gathers material and absorbs Qi energy, thus growing larger and larger, potentially replacing whole organs during its crystallogenesis. \n\n    IMBCG, for much of its development, will only cause everpresent, but slowly increasing, food cravings and mineral deficiencyies as the crystal draws from the materials the patient consumes.  IMBCG crystals also absorb the ambient [!2 Qi energy] of the infected in order to grow.  Normally, this would impair an infected person’s ability to maintain homeostasis.  But, it ultimately has limited effects on an individual's homeostasis.\u0000css\n    Most commonly, individuals contract the disease by living in an area with high concentrations of [!3 uncharged Qi Particles].  Environments such as these supplement their own levels of charged Qi, and subsequently that of the bio-crystal.  If the infected were to relocate to a less uncharged-qi-dense location, they may notice weakness across their body, as the IMBCG crystal within them would be taking a larger proportion of their body's energy.\n\n    Notably, some individuals have found themselves healthier (in some respects) after a few years of being infected, as some breeds of bio-crystals can prove beneficial as storage for Qi energy.  This means they can act as batteries, or sorts, and making the body's level of Qi saturation more stable.  Though the effect is limited, as accessing this storage for purposes other than that of their natural biology is not inherent to individuals.\n\n    Aside from the side effects of the process of growth itself, the structure that the bio-crystal grows into also has its own symptoms, due to the crystal's random formation creating random breeds of [!1 microstructure] crystals.  Often, the bio-crystals grow into and replace biological matter, taking up the shape, size, and location of an organ. Some tissue samples from IMBCG amputees have found the area around the amputated limb taking on a near lattice-like protein construction similar to Microstructured Crystals.  The exact symptoms vary depending on where the crystal manifests, but often, they are not apparent until days before death, or if the bio-crystal had grown into a visible body part.\u0000css\n    Another common symptom of IMBCG is [!4 Qi overheating].  The patient's body will have the same amount of Qi energy saturation as a healthy individual.  But, since many microstructured crystals have a higher level of Qi capacity than their component materials, the crystals usually greatly increase a patient's Qi capacity, which subsequently raises the body's amount of resting charged Qi.  As a result of raised ambient Qi levels, higher amounts of energy in a patient's body is converted to heat, which can cause a variety of issues related to heat exposure.\n\n    If the bio-crystal forms somewhere deep in the body, IMBCG can be difficult to detect until it is too late to treat.  Despite the crystalline structure often replacing many vital organs, it has more limited effects on the skeletal and nervous system.  The bio-crystal can replace bones rather easily.  Whereas, while their replacement of the nervous system and parts of the brain has negative side effects, they are noticeably reduced (as compared to manifestation in other organs).  The disease's effects are a result of crystal often replacing biological matter, as opposed to just building into it.\n    An autopsy of one victim, performed on [!5 Gallea] in the year 63, had revealed that their parietal lobe was somehow nearly-entirely replaced by IMBCG bio-crystals.  In spite of that, until days before their death, they had most of their pain, visual, and tactile sensory input still intact.  Another individual, in 89, had to have their hand amputated after they had discovered that they had a massive, aggressive, invasive IMBCG bio-crystal in their palm through receiving a cut.\u0000css\n    The only way to treat IMBCG, assuming that it was uncovered while it could still be treated, is to remove the growing bio-crystal.  This usually involves invasive surgery, or even amputations.\n\n    Interestingly, there has been research undertaken in third-world nations and backwater worlds to enhance Qi conjuration through principles related to IMBCG.  Essentially, people have made rudimentary attempts to graft Microstructured Crystals to individuals to enhance their bodies' Qi energy storage.",

Sol]'s nearest stellar neighbor, [!7 Eralux].\n        The warp relocation would take 10 weeks (3300 hours) with constant warp at 15c.\n        Upon arriving at the foreign star system, they would exit warp.\n        Then, they would locate the fourth planet from the star, [!8 Matina], and attempt to warp into its Sphere of Influence.\n        Upon entering the sphere of influence of the planet, the crew was instructed to burn into a high orbit.\n        From there, the crew would take advantage of being near a never-before-seen world and, spend most of their time taking readings and photographs of Matina.\n        The crew were instructed to warp back to their homestar after 30 hours studying the alien planet.\n        The return warp took the same amount of time as the first warp, 10 weeks (3300 hours).\n        After returning into orbit of Sol, the ship would radio to Itascus that they had returned, and wait for a go-ahead to warp back to the planet.\n        Upon warping home, the crew would bring The Pioneer into a low orbit of Itascus.\n        A small [!9 Transit-Class ship] would be sent up from the surface of Itascus to rendezvous with The Pioneer.\n        The Transit-Class Ship would retrieve the two astronauts and the Pioneer's warp drive, bringing them back down to the surface for recovery.\u0000css\n    When actually enacted, the plan succeeded.  The crew successfully performed an interstellar warp, orbited an alien planet and returned.  But, the excursion was not without problems.\n    During the warp back to Sol, about three weeks into the route, Kane Felt started experiencing severe Cabin Fever, as well as moderate psychosis.  Kane's condition is thought to have been brought on by a severe sense of [!10 Artemecia], caused by contemplating the idea of being one of the first two people of his species to travel interstellar distances and see the world of another star.\n    Fits Henton was interviewed about Kane's complication after he returned to Itascus.  He said that Kane had been talking about \"the stars\" and \"the scale of it all\" for weeks prior, ever since they had left the orbit of Matina.  He states Kane started acting strangely and despondently, often neglecting his daily exercises and forgetting to eat.  Fits worried that Kane might \"do something dangerous\" mid-warp.  Fits was allegedly able to talk Kane out of his fell mood, returning him to an operational state.\u0000css\n    Despite their turbulent journey, The Pioneer safely returned to Sol and entered into a low orbit around Itascus.  Upon recovery, the two astronauts were debriefed.  Upon learning about Kane's psychosis episode, the [!11 Itascan Space Agency] (then called the Maritine Space Agency) submitted him for a psychiatric evaluation, though, the evaluation found Kane to be perfectly mentally healthy.\n    Once The Pioneer's warp drive was recovered, it was promptly dismantled and extensively studied.  This was to determine if interstellar warps were sustainable, and if warping for extended periods of time caused damage to a warp drive, or caused the [!12 Aptha] within to become unstable.  The tests concluded that extended-distance warps were sustainable, with minimal loss of Aptha via warp.\n    \n    These events directly led to the [!13 Warp Endowment Campaign], fully bringing warp technology into the hands of the people of [!14 The Silver Stream].",

        "data": "css\n    Astrability is a term used to describe how well an object or substance withstands being subjected to space travel.  If an object is very astrable, it means it will undergo little-to-no change as it's transferred between worlds.  If an object is inastrable, however, it means that it will be degraded in quality or broken through being transferred via space.\n    For example, a titanium ball is resistant to changes in air pressure, temperature, and gravity, meaning it will not be meaningfully changed through space transit, meaning it is very astrable.  On the contrary, hydrated food (such as non-dehydrated vegetation or meats) is very susceptible to degradation caused by extreme temperatures and pressures (primarily due to water content), meaning it is not very astrable.  However, since pressure and temperature in spacecraft can be kept within an acceptable range using appropriate hardware, hydrated foods are still considered somewhat astrable since accommodations can be made to keep them from degrading in transit.\n    \n    Astrability is also a market term.  Specifically, it describes the cost-effectiveness of selling terrestrially-produced produced to off-world markets.  For example, Steel is considered inastrable by terrestrial industries.  This is because, while steel can be safely brought into space, it is very heavy as cargo.  Since Steel's price-per-weight is low, and the cost to send material into space can be high, it tends to cost more to ship steel to space than one can sell it for.\n\n    As well as the previous definitions, astrability can also describe if an item is safe to bring into space.  Most notably, items that are susceptible to [!1 Delta Popping], or contain dust/fluids are not considered very astrable due to safety concerns.\n    Astrability safety concerns led to the creation of [!2 Astrability Safety Labels] on food and other packaging.",

        "data": "css\n    Delta Popping is a phenomenon where airtight, air-filled containers violently burst when brought into a place of lower pressure, such as a spacecraft.\n\n    When it comes to space and interplanetary travel, designing common products and packages can be surprisingly difficult.  A product that's perfectly usable terrestrially may break or even literally explode when taken to space.\n    For instance, imagine a terrestrial consumer holding a small bag of foodstuffs.  This hypothetical bag is airtight, and was manufactured in an environment with 1 ATM of atmospheric pressure.  Because of this, the bag contains a volume of air at 1 ATM of pressure.  Now, spacecraft and space stations can have greatly-varying amounts of pressure.  If our hypothetical consumer were to take this sealed bag of food into a cabin with an air pressure lower than 1 ATM (as in lower than the amount of pressure the bag is filled with), the bag may burst/explode due to the pressure difference.  This phenomenon, called \"Delta Popping\" or just \"Popping\" can happen to any sealed volume of air/gas in a container.\n    \n    At its best, a container Delta Popping is inconvenient for its owner.  At its worst, Delta Popping can be a serious problem for the spacecraft it occurs within.  This is because many consumer containers, such airtight boxes, snack bags, bottles, vials, etc., contain problematic substances such as food/dust particles or fluids.  On the ground, dust and fluids don't present much of a hazard.  But in microgravity, free-floating fluids and particulates can interfere with life support systems, damage hardware, and otherwise impair the mechanisms of a spacecraft.\u0000css\n    Because of this [!1 Spacecraft Transit Bureau agents] in most [!2 spaceports] and [!3 astroports] strictly regulate which airtight containers can and can not be brought onto spacecraft.  For example, imagine a passenger from a planet with an atmospheric pressure of 1 ATM was attempting to take a half-empty bottle of detergent onto a spacecraft with an atmospheric pressure of only 1/3 ARM.  This hypothetical passenger would be inspected at the spaceport checkpoint before leaving their planet of origin.  An [!1 STB agent] would find their half-full bottle to be at risk of Delta Popping, and it would be confiscated (to be held or disposed of).\n    \n    As a workaround to Delta Popping Precautions, some commuters have taken to removing products from bags which are at risk of Delta Popping (ex: snacks, other sealed bags) and placing them instead into vacuum-compressed packaging.  Since vacuum-compressed packaging contains a negligible amount of air, it has virtually no chance of Delta Popping.",

The Isf bears a short fur coat that becomes thicker in the cold seasons.  The fur is typically a shade of grey, brown, red, and rarely, black and white.  The base color is also usually accompanied by spots or stripes of another fur color.  The Isfžr have a nubby tail consisting mainly of flesh and bone with a thin fur coat.  The Isfžr almost always have brown or black eyes, but some rare cases include Isfžr with red or orange eyes.\n\n    The Deorian Savage Isf is a mammalian creature that originates from Deoria.  They dig burrows in the ground as homes.  The Isfžr`s diet typically includes grasses and grubs.  The Isfžr are very defensive and will attack other creatures if they feel threatened by them by pouncing on them and using their teeth to puncture and tear their targets skin.  The Isfžr`s burrows are guarded by older, stronger Isfžr.\u0000css\n    Male Isfžr are found to have larger teeth than females as they are normally found guarding the outside of the burrows, while females have larger claws for digging to assist in enlarging the burrow.  On average, males are a kilogram heavier than females due to increased muscle mass.\n\n    The Isfžr are sometimes found burrowing near crop fields and consuming farmers' produce.  Modern farmers typically respond to this by spraying their crops with various pesticides.  One notorious pesticide is highly toxic to the Isfžr and only mildly dangerous towards Deorians.  This pesticide can be removed from the wheat by thoroughly soaking it in water for a few hours.\n    The Isf is a major part of Deorian cuisines.  It is typically smoked and served with a sauce of its fat drippings.",

However, the breakfast of a common Itascan is unique -- it is typically their largest meal of the day, consuming between 3,600 and 4,200 joules of energy in just one sitting!  Breakfasts this large became commonplace in ancient times, designed to give workers the extra calories need to comfortably make it through the cold days on Itascus.  Some breakfast specialties observed across the planet include domesticated lizard eggs, Reptile sausage, or Itascan Grizzly Steaks, complimented by a side of greens, such as Itascian Sourgrass.\n    \n    After eating breakfast, the common Itascan heads to work for the day.  Come lunchtime -- defined by local noon -- employees pause their work and head to a designated room eat their packed lunch.  If one's place of work has a proper mess hall, they will order food from the in-house kitchen (as opposed to packing their own).  And Itascan lunch is the smallest meal of the day, usually just being a sandwich or seed roll.  Within Itascan companies, lunchtime typically ushers in a 30 to 45 minute lunch break.  After which work resumes until the end of the work day, which is typically in the mid-afternoon, though sometimes later.\u0000css\n    For most Itascans, from this point on in the day is leisure time, just doing things like going home, partying at a public venue, spending time with their friends, and whatever else they feel like they want to do.  Dinnertime can happen either in the home or at a public resturaunt.  An Itascan dinner is typically protein-heavy; usually, dinner has some type of meat as its main course, with small sides of greens or grains.\n    \n    At bedtime, a common Itascan will put their children to rest and climb into bed with their spouse, resting themself up for the next day.  The Itascan work cycle is 10 days in total (akin to [!3 Standard Galactic Time]), and is 7 days on, 3 days off, and is equal to exactly 10 orbits of Itascus around [!4 Skoth].",

As this is a pulse laser rifle, it is best used for anti-personnel applications.  Although the Warden makes built with a new capacitor bank, it is still charged with an [!2 Atlas Universal Charger].\n\n    Built into the upper receiver is eight LEDs which act as a charge counter.  This counter starts with all eight LEDs lit, and one LED dims for each shot fired.  The addition of this counter is so the user can focus more on firing the weapon, not having to keep count of the ammunition in their head, as the counter will do it for them.\n    The barrel of the rifle does not extend past the front handguard, making the weapon rather compact and easily transportable when the capacitor is ejected.  The eight charge-capacitor can be inserted and ejected from what would be considered the upper receiver of the rifle, and extends out from the sides of the weapon.  Once chambered, a pin holds the capacitor in place while allowing it to rotate.  The pin extends beyond the back of the chambered, ending with a small pull handle.  To eject the capacitor, the user must disengage the pin by pulling its handle (spent capacitor banks can be recharged).\u0000css\n    As per standard of Atlas, the rifle features universal tactical rail mounts on the upper receiver, and on all four sides of the handguard.  As this is a rifle that will be intended for use on extended operations as well as short-term engagements, extensive research went into making sure the rifle is built as light as possible, using similar methods of manufacturing and materials that went into the [!3 Vega].\n\n    This is the second weapon produced by Atlas Corp., with the company's vision still being set on producing laser weaponry.  Purchase of rifle will run a buyer around $750, including one capacitor bank.  Individual 8-round capacitor banks for the ACLR-X are sold at $80 dollars per unit.  Atlas also manufactures 6-round banks, which are sold at a cheaper $60.\n\n    It was documented multiple times during product testing that many who fired the Warden mentioned that it \"gives off a satisfying smell of ozone\".",

For optimal effectiveness, KBWs dropped from orbit are built with basic flight computers controlling actuated fins to allow the projectiles to make course adjustments mid-flight, after the projectiles have entered an atmosphere.\n    \n    Kinetic Bombardment Weapons were invented on [!2 Itascus], and refined through the [!3 Itacan Great War], in which it became an impactful, history-changing weapon.

        "data": "css\n    The Itascan Great War (A.K.A. the Itascan Unification War) was a war between the [!1 eight major nations of Itascus]: Corrum, Amenira, Saryllia, and Finnia formed a collective called the Social Pact, while Amora, Borone, Queensland, and Carria formed the South Itascan Treaty Organization, or SITO.\n    The Social Pact nations were bound by their common interest in their nations' economic structure, then called \"Socio-Capitalisim\", which was a form of socialist economy that provided necessities to its people through considerable taxes, while still respecting personal capital.  Meanwhile, the nations of SITO saw Socio-Capitalisim as an infectious, volatile, and unfruitful economic system which hindered a nation's growth, threatening the economies of their own states, and that of Itascus at large.\n    \n    The war had sparked the attention of those all across the [!2 Silver Stream], leading some galactic powers to intervene.  Alien [!3 Deorian] forces supported the Social Pact, whilst [!4 Tuine] forces supported SITO, partially making the Itascan Great War a proxy war these two galactic powers.  The war was started over SITO nations passing the Ameniran Exclusion Act (AEA), which prevented all Amenirans entering SITO territory, banning trade with Amenira, and threatening to neutralize all Ameniran spacecraft that orbit over SITO lands, which threatened to greatly hinder, or even end, Amineran space exploration.\n\n    A year after the AEA was instated, Amenira gathered leaders of the other member nations of the Social Pact and rallied them for war, explaining that SITO only wanted to slow the progress of Socialized Capitalisim, and that their own nations could very well be next.  This meeting would come to be known as the Social Summit.  After that meeting, the nations of the Social Pact formally declared war on the nations of SITO.  This officially started the Itascan Great War on 5/12/17.\u0000css\n    Queensland, which shared their northern border with Amenira, fell to their invasion before foriegn forces could aid them, as their capital was firebombed to the ground amongst many other of their cities.  During the ensuing peace talks, there were accounts of the Ameniran president slapping the king of Queensland.  With the Silver Stream sitting in the wake of First Contact, it didn't take long for news of Itascus' war to spread to other nearby worlds.  Specifically, denizens of [!5 Deoria] sympathized with the Social Pact, while Bius Tu saw a potential ally in the powers of SITO.\n    \n    Three years into the conflict, as battles were being fought on multiple fronts, foreign military aid from Deoria, backing the SP; and Bius Tu, backing SITO, had arrived.  The majority of Deorian Aid was in the form of laser weapons and military ordinance with only a few hundred Deorian soldiers, while Bius Tu sent many dozen versatile military transport vehicles and almost two-thousand Tuine infantry members.\n\n    After the arrival of foriegn military aid, the nations of the Social Pact pushed South in a deadly campaign known as the 6 Month Charge, where it is said \"they did not take one step back\".  Eventually, Carria had to move their capital south, and in a desperate attempt at survival, unleashed their \"Death Machines\" -- mechanized, weaponized, quadrapedal walking armored vehicles, which were the precursor to modern [!6 Power Armor].  The advent of mechanized warfare caught the Social Pact off gaurd, and the Great Retreat over Carria began as Carrian Death Machines, accompanied by [!4 Tuine] tanks and APCs, pushed the Social Pact's forces back.\u0000css\n    While they were retreating, Amenira resorted to more desprate measures as the Social Pact's combined forces fled.  Amenira soon found that ultra-heavy guided [!7 kinetic projectiles] dropped from aircraft were remarkably effective at taking out the Carrian Death Machines.  Within a week, the 100 death machines of Carria fell to Ameniran Air Superiority Division bombers, marking the end of the Great Retreat over Carria.  At this time, Amenira launched their Hammerfall Orbital Strike sattelites -- which utilized the same technology as the [!7 kinetic projectiles] used against the Death Machines -- to execute their ultimate warplan.  As the Social Pact retook the front, they comandeered any remaining working War Machines, with each member nation's military taking any intact specimens to reverse-engineer.\n\n    Deorians brought in their [!8 laser rifles], adding the smell of seared flesh and ozone to the many scents of the great Itascan battlefield.  The tables turned back in the favor of the Social Pact, and another offensive began.  On the oceans of Itascus, the Social Pact and SITO waged war with metal beasts called warships, manned by legions of crewmen.  These warships were endowed with the largest guns ever concieved by Itascan scientists at that time, shielded by armor once considered to be impossibly thick.\u0000css\n    During the later years of the Great War, years 20 to 23 [!9 Post Warp], the massive guns of warships were replaced with [!10 hypersonic railguns], capable of shooting targets at 50 kilometers away.  The railgun design was invented by Ameniran Dynamics -- now known as [!11 Itascan Dynamics], the premier kinetic weapons manufacturer of the [!12 Itascian Military].  SITO warships soon carried planes, where pilots would attack Social Pact ships with bombs and guided rockets.  Social Pact nations responded by fielding defensive aircraft carriers of their own, and attatching laser [!13 point defense] grids to their seacraft.  As Social pact warships pushed south, they launched missiles and railgun shells to support ground troops near the coast.  As they aproached the southern parts of the Patrician Ocean, into the Boronian Sea, Borone surrendured under threat of nuclear fire.\n    \n    In the last year of the war, Amenira made conservative use of their Hammerfall Orbital Strike system, bombarding some opposing cities with monolithic projectiles of pure tungsten, devistating structrues and causing general chaos in SITO population centers.  But the nation Amora, outside of the knowledge of the Social Pact and without informing any other SITO nation, had also constructed their own, smaller, kinetic bombardment station in Itascan orbit, copying the Amenirans.  Secretly, they targeted the Ameniran capital, a large city on the east coast of the [!14 Ferika Continent].  Off the east shore of Ferika is a deep geological fault line, which, at the time, was primed to shift.  The Amoran military dropped two rods of pure tungsten 11 kilometers off the coast of the Ameniran capital.  The rods were to be dropped one after another, with the second rod acting as redundancy if the first rod failed to trigger the fault line.\u0000css\n    On 1/38/23, an 11-ton rod of tungsten struck the ocean just off the Amineran coast, triggering a wave over 50 meters tall to strike the Ameniran capital.  The force of the wave, as well as the ensuing flood, decimated the city by toppling buildings and leveling neighborhoods in an artificial disaster which killed tens of thousands.  The capital, which previously had a population of over one million, was crippled in under an hour.  In the aftermath, almost a fifth of the city's population had perished from the flood, or being unable to escape through the crumbled infrastructure of what was once a metropolis.\n    The Itascan president survived the flood thanks to the Presidential Bunker he had commissioned at the beginning of the war.  Immediately, in under a day, the Itascan president ordered a large Ameniran city to the west, further inland on the slope of a mountain, to be adopted as a temporary military headquarters and capital.  This city, after the war, would come to be the official capital city of the planet.\n    \n    Shortly after the fall of the Ameniran capital, Deoria sent an order to withdraw their forces from Itascus, leaving their military hardware, but returning Deorian soldiers to their homeworld.  The withdrawl was a bad sign for citizens of Social Pact nations, and re-sparked civil discussions regarding the ethics of stronger extrastellar powers meddling in Itascan affairs.\u0000css\n    On [!15 Erii], as the Great War waged on, Ameniran and Carrian colonies openly harassed eachother, stealing supplies, damaging hardware, and even attempting to occupy opposing colonies in decentralized acts of hostility.  At the time, Erii's atmosphere wasn't yet breathable, as it still had too high a concentration of Carbon Dioxide.  Subsequently, this meant colonies required a constant flow of supplies and functioning machinery to keep their occupants alive.  Through the skirmishes, entire colonies suffocated and starved due to supply shortages, giving the phenomenon the name of \"General Eriian Famine\".  Eventually, Carrian colonies submitted to the Ameniran attacks, effectively winning the war on Erii.  Though, with conflict in the air, ideas of Eriian Sepratism (from Itascus) spread among Eriian reactionaries.\n\n    At this stage of the war, SITO was on the backfoot, and national leaders considered surrendering to the waves of Social Pact fighters and war machines.  The Carrian Death Machines had been reverse-engineered by Social Pact militaries into an archaic form of Power Armor which was being eagerly deployed onto the battlefield.  Much of Itascus had been devistated by the war, and the public cry for peace had grown exponentially louder as casualties rose.\n    With SITO nearly at its knees, and the Social Pact strained and beaten by the conflict, the world collectively agreed it was time for change.  SITO had been beaten, and the Social Pact controlled the terms of surrender.  In many Social Pact cultures, the idea of a unified Itascus being essential to survival in the emerging interstellar stage had become very popular.  This is partially accredited to opposing Tuine forces remaining active on Itascus this far in the war; [!16 Tuines] had even become demonized in some circles.\u0000css\n    On 8/14/23, the leaders of the Social Pact conviened and announced a month-long ceasefire, which the remaining active members of SITO -- Amora and Borone -- agreed to.  The Social Pact held a summit of their own, with the Pact's national leaders meeting in the capital of Finnia.  This summit would come to be known as the [!17 Finnia Accords].  In these accords, a government structure for a unified Itascus was drafted and vetted, with the Social Pact offering to stop hostilities towards each nation that agreed to be annexed into the new Itascan nation.\n    The only nation to refuse was Amora, whose leaders cited such a plan would forsake individual nations' powers and rights.  Shortly after their refusal, the Great War resumed, though only on Amoran fronts.  \n    \n    Only a day into the resumed conflict, the Amoran capital was relentlessly bombarded from orbit by Ameniran military spacecraft in what would become a devistating, intimidating show of space-based weaponry and Ameniran power.  Amoran ground troops were quickly overrun by the combined infantry of every Social Pact nation within an [!18 Itascan Week].  The nation of Amora surrendered on 10/2/23, agreeing to be annexed into an Itascan planetary Nation and officially ending the Itascan World War.",

It's a small, cheap machine meant for driving light hardware systems.  The model is meant specifically for personal integrated systems.\n    The model has no internal disk drive of any sort.  Instead, the machine contains one 128KiB chip of programmable ROM that can act as Firmware and/or read-only program code.  Despite this, an editable data volume can still be connected to the system via one of its exterior [!2 UHB] ports.  While the system itself is not able to write to its internal ROM, the ROM can be edited via the machine's 16-Bit [!3 Main Memory Access] port.\n    \n    This model is in a very compact form factor, fitting in a small box frame, measuring only 22 by 18 by 6 centimeters in size.  On the top of the Scrub's case, the largest face of the chassis, is \"Datec Scrub\" in large, engraved text justified to at the top.  In the bottom left of the top face is minimal information about the machine, such as unit serial number and model power requirements.\u0000css\n    As a final step in manufacturing, the Scrub's case is filled with an expanding, hardening, non-conductive foam.  While this makes the machine very difficult to repair, it greatly increases the unit's durability.  This, combined with the fact that it has no internal moving parts, means that it can stand up to great physical stresses; it's said that the model can \"survive anything short of a bullet\".  By default, a Scrub's internal ROM contains a copy of the [!4 MoTran] computer operating system.\n    After manufacturing, units are sold and shipped to 3rd party producers, such as [!5 Atlas] or [!6 Outerweapon].  Upon arrival, individual Scrubs typically have their ROMs overwritten with proprietary code, firmware, and/or files.  After which, the Scrub is augmented with application-specific hardware, and re-sold by the 3rd-party company.\n\n    Originally produced in 53, the Scrub has found popular use as a high-tolerance, general purpose, cheap field computer.  Since its inception, over 200 million units have been sold to companies all across the [!7 Silver Stream].  Even now, some 50-year-old units can still be found across the galaxy, still in working order.",

The HUD displays the ammo count of each weapon connected to the system.  The target computer is guided by two IR cameras mounted in the helmet, and a gyroscope and an accelerometer in the connected weapon.  The system uses infrared(thermal) light to idenfity targets.  In total, Shuvuran unit consists of a [!1 Scrub] field computer, two [!2 UHB]-connected IR cameras, a transparent screen connected via the Scrub's [!3 MMA port], and a proprietary UHB cable that connected to any compatible weapon.\n\n    The system manifests as a small targeting computer affixed with adhesives to the back of a user's helmet.  A thin, transparent, 256 by 384 pixel, black-and-white screen (which offers no armor advantage), is placed in front of the user's face.  In order for the system to work, the user must also install both of the system's IR cameras on either side of their helmet.  Once the Shuvuran system is installed into a user's helmet, the user then needs to calibrate the system to account for discrepancies in placement of the IR cameras and/or HUD screen.  After calibration, the system is ready for use (instructions for calibration are provided in the Shuvuran's manual).\u0000css\n    On the HUD screen, the user is presented with numbered bounding boxes of all IR-emitting(meaning warm) objects in the user's line of sight.  After showing the user the bounding boxes of all sources of Infrared Light, user can then select one of them for the system to target (specfically, the target is selected using buttons on the attached weapon's grip).  The Shuvuran's guidance computer's IR telemeter then determines the distance to the target and its position relative to the gun.  \n\n    Many militaries across the GCP have expressed interest in the system, but a combination of cost and worries over national sovereignty and dependance toward la'foy have prevented the system from getting widespread adoption outside of the La'Foyan military.  The system is sold directly by Outerweapon at a cost of $3500 per unit.  The system exist in two versions -- The original version grants a change of +3 to a weapon's accuracy and -3 to its precision and an updated version, made in 101PW, grants +5 acuracy and only -2 precision.\n\nSpecial Information:\n    The Shuvuran System only works with firearms specifically designed for Shuvuran compatibility",

An internal gyroscope can be embedded into the handle to allow for connecting the weapon to a [!2 outerweapon`s Shuvuran Aiming System] for higher accuracy. \n\n    The gun's chassis is coated with lightweight [!3 carbon fiber] and offers an elegant, streamlined design.  The ammo cylinder of the revolver can be swapped out in its entirety faster reloading.  Outerweapon sells extra revolver cylinders for 150$ per cylinder.  When replacing the cylinder, reloading the entire clip only takes about three seconds.\n\n    The Shuvuran-compatible version of the rifle features a circle pad under the thumb for control of the [!2 Shuvuran targeting system], as well as a medium-large rail on the top of the barrel allow for [!4 weapon modifications].  Outerweapon offers a price of 2100$ per-unit for the revolver, with an extra 500$ for Shuruvan compatibility.\u0000css\n    The ammo used by the revolver, the [!5 outer gyro], is self-propelled.  Thanks to this, the gun has virtually no recoil.  The use of a gyrojet ammo is the reason why the weapon sports highly-recognisable exhaust vents on the sides of its barrel.  Individual Outer-gyro ammo costs 12$ per round on average.\n\n    The revolver has been produced since the inception of the Outerweapon company, and is cited as one of the the reasons why the company has become a prominent manufacturer within the [!6 GCP].\n\nSpecial information:\n    Due to the self-propelled nature of the ammunition, the armor piercing power of the weapon follows the following rule:\n    When fired, the AP rating of a gyro bullet starts at 1 and increases by 1 every 3 meters the bullet traverses in flight, up to a maximum of 6.",

If the rifle is bought directly from Outerweapon, a buyer can pay $1,000 added cost to have the handle and foregrip shaped custom to its owner (this grants a rating bonus +1 Accuracy when being used by the owner).  Due to the use of a gyrojet ammunition, the barrel is very light and short, and individual rounds are loaded with a bullpup mechanism.  Thanks to these two attributes, the rifle is exceptionally compact, with a length of 45 cm and light with a weight of 1.7 kg when unloaded. \n\n    This rifle was the first built with the Shuvuran system in mind, allowing for an easy and cheap integration of required Shuvuran components, like the gyroscope or the thumb pad.  A Medium-large rail is present on the top of the rifle to allow for [!3 weapon attachments].\u0000css\n    The rifle is sold at a price of $5000 per unit, with an added $300 for [!4 shuvuran] compatibility.  A Gamma Assault Rifle that was not manufactured with Shuvuran compatibility can be modified to be made compatible, but this is costlier and a more complex process.  Thanks to its precision and its exceptionally low-weight, this weapon is standard issue for some Special Ops ranks of the [!5 La`Foyan Military].\n\n\nSpecial information:\n    Due to the self-propelled nature of the ammunition, the armor piercing power of the weapon follows the following rule:\n    When fired, the AP rating of a gyro bullet starts at 1 and increases by 1 every 3 meters the bullet traverses in flight, up to a maximum of 6.",

Coins with values of $100 or greater are cast from stainless steel of a specific [!4 microstructure] to discourage counterfieting.\n        Every denomination is labeled with its value in ITC and the year in which it was minted.  Units produced after 26 P.W. are adorned with small artwork depicting various events in [!5 Itascan history].  All Itascan Coins were minted on [!6 planetary Itascus] until 44 P.W. where they began federally-overseen production on all [!7 Itascan planetary territories].  All units manufactured after 44 P.W. are engraved with an image of the planet they were made on on the side opposite of the mark of its value.  The image of the planet is centered on the ground location of the mint where the coin was manufactured.\u0000css\n    La'Foyan Zenwanc -- [Þ] (ZWC) {Þ5.32 ZWC = $1 ITC}\n    Denominations: Þ1, Þ2, Þ4, Þ8, Þ32, Þ48, Þ64, Þ256, Þ512\n    Backed by: Silver\n    Jurisdictions: [!8 La'Foy], [!9 Armalai]\n    Description:\n        ZWC coins are small (7cm height, 1cm diameter) cylinders made of various materials.  One end of the cylinder is stamped/embossed with its value in ZWC.  Originally, on ancient [!10 La'Foy], ZWC were backed by various metals -- the metal a denomination was backed by was that of its composition (ex. a ZWC made of copper would be equivalent to a certain amount of copper).  This was changed in the [!11 galactic 10s] as [!2 Itascans] (and their influence) arrived on La'Foy.  Modern ZWC are made out of Iron or Copper, and are backed by a single metal: Silver. \n\n\n    Solar Coins -- [$] (SUC) {$0.91 SUC = $1 ITC}\n    Denominations: $0.1, $0.25, $0.5, $1, $5, $10, $25, $50, $100, $200, $1,000\n    Backed by: [!3 Solar Union Government]\n    Jurisdictions: [!3 Solar Union]\n    Description:\n        SUC units are very similar to ITC.  SUC units with a value of less than $1 are small (3cm diameter) coins made of polished cast iron.  Units with values from $1 to $50 are made of nickel-zinc alloy, and are slightly larger (4cm diameter).  Units with values of $100 and above are made of gold-plated steel, and are 6cm in diameter.  Each coin is labeled with its value on both sides, and is embossed with a select quote (related to Solar Union) history written in [!12 Unil] around the rim of both faces.\n        Following in the footsteps of ITC minters, SUC coins with values greater than $25 are made of specific [!4 microstructures] of metal to discourage counterfieting starting in 47 P.W., but the Solar Union minters chose to use a microstructure that made the coins shimmer in light, but considerably reduced their structural integrity.  As well as switching to microstructured metal, SUC minted after 47 are stamped with a unique unit serial number.\u0000css\n    Armalite Credits -- [¤] (ARC) {¤2.41 - ¤4.69 ARC = $1 ITC}\n    Denominations: Any, ¤1, ¤4, ¤8, ¤32, ¤64, ¤256, ¤512, ¤2048\n    Backed by: Digital Credit\n    Jurisdictions: [!9 Armalai]\n    Description:\n        Physical Armalite Credits, called \"Tiles\" in [!12 Unil] or \"Shengwanc\" in [!13 Nunwei], are small (7cm by 6cm), thin rectangles made of plastic or other light polymers that come in faded colors.   Credits are thick (1cm) at the rim, but inset and thinner (~4mm) further in; this is to allow credits to 'click' into eachother and stack -- the back face of any ARC neatly slots into the front face of any other since all denominations are the same size.  In the inset face of credit is its value written in [!13 Nunwei] numerics, with the same value written in [!12 Unil] numerics under it.  While standard denominations of credits come in, values of 1, 4, 8, 64, 256, and 512, other denominations of arbitrary values (ex 3, 5, 371) exist and are perfectly valid forms of credits.\n        While ARC units come in a variety of colors, the color of an individual tile is determined by its value: ¤1 tiles are red, ¤4 tiles are orange, ¤8 tiles are yellow, ¤32 tiles are orange, ¤64 tiles are yellow, ¤256 tiles are green embedded with lime glitter, ¤512 tiles are blue embedded with cyan glitter, ¤2048 tiles are violet embedded with purple glitter, and tiles of arbitrary denominations are white.\n        Along the top edge of a credit tile is two adjacent arrays of small plastic bumps and gaps, with each bump and gap spaced about a millimeter apart.  These arrays of bumps are for interfacing with automatic cashier machines.  The top-right array is 16-bit and encodes the tile's credit value, and the top-left array is 40-bit and encodes the tile's unique serial number.\u0000css\n        The value of an Armalite credit varies so much because it's an extension of the Armalite Controlled Digital Economy -- the majority of domestic Armalite funds exists digitally in the planet's [!14 Overnet] system, and is the defacto form of the currency.  Digital Armalite credits are simply called \"Credits\", or \"Shengwan\" in [!13 Nunwei].  The value of the Armalite Credit varies frequently and intentionally, controlled by the state.  While this is to keep the planetary economy stable, this has led some foriegn investors to see the Armalite economy as Unstable.\n\n\n    Tuine Dyian'ye -- [Ð] (BTD) {Ð17.44 BTD = $1 ITC}\n    Denominations: Ð1, Ð5, Ð10, Ð50, Ð100, Ð500, Ð1,000, Ð5,000, Ð10,000\n    Backed by: [!15 Tuine Government]\n    Jurisdictions: [!15 Bius Tu]\n    Description:\n        Tuine Dyian'ye (pronounced \"de-en-ya\") comes in two forms: bills and coins.  Dyian'ye with a value of Ð500 or less are made as wood-paper bills, while Dyian'ye with greater values are made as metal coins.  The Dyian'ye was originally backed by metallic gold, but it was changed to being backed by the Tuine Government in 62 P.W. after a brief instance of runaway inflation on [!16 planetary Bius Tu].\n        Dyian'ye in bill form are made out of tough, thin wood-made cloth, and are 6.5cm by 13cm in size.  On bill Dyian'ye, the denomination's value in BTD is printed on the top right and bottom left of of the front side, with a small image of great Tuine invention at a cinematic angle in the middle.  Below the image is the date of the bill's printing.  On the back side of the bill is a larger image of that same invention, but at a different, usually more descriptive, perspective.  For example, on the Ð50 BTD bill images of the [!17 Syakyl spaceplane] -- one images of the ship in spaceflight on the front, and three images of the ship from the side, front, and top on the back.\u0000css\n        Coin Dyianye are all 6cm in diameter and made of Nickel.  On one face of the coin is its value and the year in which it was minted.  On the other is an embossed image of [!16 planetary Bius Tu], [!18 Osirja], or a species from the [!19 Beius vivotype].  Embedded in each nickel coin is a smaller, brass coin/circle in its center.  In larger denominations of coin, the brass inner circle takes up a larger proportion of the coin.  This is because, in ancient times, Tuine coins consisted of Iron with a Gold center.  Though in -11 P.W., as treasuries were enstated, the gold core of the coins was changed to gold-plated copper, becoming more of a symbolic token.  In 62, once the currency was no longer gold-backed, new coins were minted with brass in place gold or copper.\n        \n    \n    Deorian Shenyak -- [ß] (DOS) {ß0.50 DOS = $1 ITC}\n    Denominations: ß1, ß4, ß8, ß16, ß64, ß128, ß256, ß1024, ß2048\n    Backed by: [!20 Deorian Government]\n    Jurisdictions: [!20 Deoria], [!21 Ghillymede]\n        Deorian currency comes in the form of either circular, 4-sided, or 8-sided coins, minted out of bronze, Sterling silver, or pure silver/gold alloy.  Each holds a small square hole in the center used for threading coins together for easy storage and transport.  All coins feature an image of a [!22 Deorian]'s antlers accompanied by an official seal on the front and the coin's value on the back, alongside other elegant engravings.\n\n        8-sided coins are worth twice much as their 4-sided counterparts, an example being a 4-sided bronze coin being worth 4 Shenyaktik while the 8-sided is worth 8 Shenyaktik. Bronze is the least valuable of the coins, with Sterling silver coins being worth 16 times the value of their respective bronze counterparts, while silver-gold coins are worth 256 times their bronze counterparts, or 16 times the Sterling Silver variants.\u0000css\n    Gallean Galix -- [Ԙ] (GLX) {Ԙ1 GLX = $1.50 ITC}\n    Denominations: Ԙ.25, Ԙ.50, Ԙ1, Ԙ2, Ԙ5, Ԙ10, Ԙ20, Ԙ50, Ԙ100, Ԙ1000\n    Backed by: [!23 Gallean Government]\n    Jurisdictions: [!23 Gallea], [!21 Ghillymede]\n        Gallean currency has a uniform shape of a circle with a square hole punched through its center in all denominations, about 1cm thick and 5.5cm in diameter.  The center square has vertical indentations to easily create a stack using rods of a complementary shape.  The coins usually consist of a material core disk surrounded by a 2mm-thick outer edge, with the outer edge being a circular piece of metal, the square hole being made of the same outer metal. \n        The coin’s denomination is related to its material.  The Ԙ.25 unit has a copper metal and light-pink-hardened-glass core, Ԙ.50 has a copper metal and a darker-pink-hardened-glass core.  The Ԙ1 has a steel metal and a light-blue-hardened-glass core, the Ԙ2 has a steel metal and a dark-blue-hardened-glass core.  The Ԙ5 has a steel metal and a diluted-jade core, and the Ԙ10 has a stainless-steel-metal and a full-jade core.  The Ԙ25 has a stainless steel metal and a half-flint, half clear-hardened-glass core.  The Ԙ50 has a gold metal and a full flint core.  The Ԙ100 has a gold metal and am obsidian core.  And finally, the Ԙ1000 has platinum metal and a red obsidian core. \n        All denominations up to Ԙ25 are machine-engraved.  Denominations worth Ԙ25 and up are laser engraved.  These engravings are, official Gallean markings on the surrounding metal band stating ‘Official Gallean Currency’ in [!24 Gallean], the unit's denomination written on the core, a serial number wrapped around the square, and authentication holes that burrow into the core at various depths.",

Historically, the [!2 Ceiraz], as a people, have been seen as more philosophically-oriented than other Deorian peoples of their time.  This led them to pave the way for Pacemism, the traditional Ceiraz religion and belief system, based off of ideas concieved by Ceiraz philosophers through meditation and speculation regarding how to live better lives during [!3 Deoria’s] Bronze to Iron Age.  Several aspects of the religion, however, culminated in the times before and after that of its initial founding.\n\n    The primary focus of Pacemism is to improve its followers’ lives by providing guidelines for living peacefully, knowledgeably, and wisely.  This is to be achieved through frequent nightly meditation; having a desire for nonviolence, peace, and prosperity; being good-willed towards fellow life (especially other sapients and concious beings); maintaining balance in nature; and striving for \"enlightenment\", a term whose ultimate definition is considered different for each individual follower based off of what they wish to achieve through following the religion’s teachings.\n    Typically, Pacemism imposes dietary restrictions; Pacemists are not to consume any immature animal, nor are they allowed to domesticate animals nor eat any animals that have been domesticated.  On a side note, cannibalism (or consuming any sapient) is also strictly prohibited.  In summary, Pacemists should not consume farmed animal products, animal products from immature animals, eggs, or people.  Also, Pacemists are to practice reserving the night for meditation and sleep only, thus, all food must be prepared and eaten in the day.\u0000css\n    Pacemists also practice a burial ritual involving dressing the recently deceased in fine clothing, seating them in a calm, quiet place, as though the corpse were meditating.  Those performing the ritual are expected to meditate into the night with the body.  The corpse is then left alone to \"meditate\" peacefully, only being visited occasionally during the night to be meditated with again as an act of mourning, if one wishes to do so.  Once the body begins to show signs of decay, the body is taken to a resting place.  In these resting places, small, upright, above-ground coffin-tombs are constructed.  These coffins are 1^3 to 2^3 cubic meters in size, being relatively spacious for a corpse.  The body is placed sitting upright in a wooden coffin, as if it were meditating.  The coffin is then surrounded in earthen clay then treated with fire to make it more resilient, as the resting places are meant to stay standing indefinitely.  Many wealthy Pacemists have ornate altars constructed in or outside of their tombs, while commoner Pacemists simply have their coffin-tombs, usually placed in large graveyards containing vast fields of other coffins.",

It is a herbivorous mammal that partially resembles a [!3 Ceiraz Deorian] in appearance and structure, with the addition of long, silky, wool which it grows out completely before cold seasons approach their area of habitation (as opposed to a [!3 Ceiraz Deorian]’s thicker, poofier coat of fur), allowing it to stay warm in the mountains and forest highlands from which it originated.  The wool begins to shed upon the end of the cold season, and is usually completely gone by mid-Spring.\u0000css\n    Even though the Ni̤fra̤v normally sprints quadrupedally (on all fours) to maneuver quickly, the Tribal Deer also has the interesting ability to slowly waddle on its hind legs whilst being able to grab objects with its front appendages (making them act as primitive arms).  The creature is genetically similar to the sapient Deorian races, and similarly displays intriguing levels of intelligence, even sometimes found manipulating items with its \"hands\" and utilizing them as tools or giving them to other creatures, even Deorians, as gifts.  A few common examples of this would be the usage of sticks as weapons to fend off predators and the occasional occurrence of a Tribal Deer plucking wild berries from bushes and handing them to nearby Deorians.\n\n    The Deorian Ni̤fra̤v displays a high level of sociability in general, and they are typically seen in large groups of around ten to fifty, resembling tribes.  When two tribes of Deer meet in nature, they typically merge into one larger tribe if there are no major barriers between them.  These tribes of Ni̤fra̤v live together in a seemingly-unmoving section of a forest, performing their daily activities together, such as gathering edible vegetation, defending themselves and eachother from predators or hostiles (such as the [!4 Deorian Savage Isf], which sometimes compete with the Tribal Deer for territory), mating, and sometimes even more complex activities such as trading food and items with one other (and sometimes even with local Deorians).",

One Chella is equal to 32 kibijoules, or 32,768 joules, of stored Qi Energy.\n\n    Qi Energy is an essential part of [!2 Biology], as most all living creatures use Qi Energy to store energy and maintain homeostasis (primarily as a potential source of heat).  It is similarly used in most types of batteries across the [!3 GCP], with the Qi Energy being used to store power.\n\n    Qi Energy can \"manifest\" in and propagate through material in an almost identical manner to Heat Energy.  Qi Energy spreads through contact, from high concentration to low concentration, until the Qi Energy in an area has reached equilibrium.  Though, Qi Energy generally propagates through substances and materials many times faster than Heat Energy (not always, as a material's Qi Conductivity is often not proportional to its Heat Conductivity).\n    All materials have a \"Qi Conductivity\", which determines the rate at which Qi Energy flows within it.

        "data": "css\n    Spoofball is a sport generally considered to be the \"National Sport of [!1 Itascus]\".  The sport features two teams of sixteen players, playing in a \"Spoofball Pit,\" a 40x20 meter recessed court with walls at a 65 degree incline, and 4 goal hoops, two each on the far sides which the teams try to aim the Spoofball into.  These goals are about 80 cm wide.  The court is divided into four even slices, indicated via lines on the floor -- for each half of the court, the inner segment is called the \"fray\", and the outer segment, which holds the goals, is called the \"base\".\n    The sport is played with \"Spoofball Gloves,\" which are hardened gloves designed to stop players from grabbing the ball or injuring their hands during play, and a 30-cm-wide inflatable rubber ball.  Teams are to sort themselves into two groups of eight, becoming the 'front' and 'back' half-teams; the front group occupies the Fray segment of the court, playing offensively, while the back group occupies the Home, playing defense.  The object of the game is to put the spoofball into one of the other team's goal hoops by punching at the ball, no grabbing allowed.  If and whenever the ball leaves the court, the ref may throw it (typically haphazardly) back into the fray along the center line on the court, continuing play.  The same applies whenever the ball comes to rest on the floor, as in the ref is allowed to interfere.  Though, repeated, biased interference from the ref may disqualify a game, so such activity is rare.  In Professional games of spoofball, however, the ref is only allowed to touch the ball if it leaves the court.\u0000css\n    Spoofball is incredibly popular on Itascus, first invented by street children during the [!2 Itascan Unification War].  16 children, in two teams of 8, would wear leather gloves in a dried out culvert or crater and vied to hit balls past eachother.  In fact, it's rumored that the original Spoofball Pit was a crater left by artillery during the war.  Later, the parents of those children took note of the game, refined the sport by recording the roles, and started sharing it, thus \"Spoofball\" -- a spoof on the childrens' game -- was created.\n    Competitive Spoofball teams may often break out in fights over things such as accusations of cheating, accidents, and sometimes just over bad blood from in (or out of) the pit.  This behavior is technically disallowed in professional play, but it is rarely stopped unless severe, only penalized.  Due to the fairly isolated environment of the \"pit,\" fights are often allowed to play out without interruption; typically, the only person allowed to enter the pit is the referee, who is usually underequiped to break up fights of more than a few players.  This behavior gave Spoofball the reputation of a heavy contact sport, and caused the phrase \"A game of spoofball broke out\" to gain popularity as a figurative way of saying there was a brawl.",

Its grains make up many staple foods on Deoria and Deorian worlds, and the plant is farmed on massive scales on such planets.  When in its developmental stages, the wheat appears a bright emerald color.  Once the wheat has blossomed and ripened, it is usually a lighter, more muted shade of green.  The grains, when crushed into flour or meal, make for a light green powder which has numerous applications, primarily in cooking food.\n\n    Deorian wheat is the domesticated form of a type of wild grain that would’ve grown out in the vast Deorian grasslands in ancient times.  There is considerable historical evidence that shows that grain in general has been harvested since long before the beginning of written history, perhaps even having served as nutrition for an ancestor of the Deorian species as a whole.  It is believed that Deorian wheat was first cultivated by an ancient civilization that occupied an area that is now a part of [!2 Milland].\u0000css\n\n    The grain was originally ground into a coarse meal which would have either been boiled down with water into a thick porridge -- potentially sweetened with pieces of fruit or berries -- or simply mixed with water to form a lean dough, rolled out to be thin, and baked in the residual heat of a recently-used clay oven to make an unleavened flatbread.  This flatbread would’ve likely been consumed alongside a roasted fowl or [!3 Isf], or, alternatively, toasted a little more until hard and dry and used as a travel food.\n    \n    It is theorized that yeast (or yeast-like cultures of microbe) was first cultivated by accident using Deorian wheat, potentially when an individual left uncooked porridge to sit during a warm season.  Regardless of origin, the discovery of yeast was revolutionary for ancient Deorian cuisine; soon, bread was almost always baked with the addition of a yeast culture by most advanced agrarian civilizations.  As time progressed, the usage of Fi̤s flour/meal became more and more widespread and diverse, soon being used for all sorts of culinary applications, from historical breads and porridges, to gravies and sauces to pastries.\n    \n    Apart from being used in food, Fïs is also used as feed for many domesticated animals.\n\n    Evidently, wild [!3 Isfžr] are drawn to this plant's grains, and have frequently posed a problem for Deorian wheat farmers, who often manage to discover burrows near or in their fields.  To combat this problem, farmers would’ve traditionally \"hired\" [!4 Ni̤fra̤v] to help keep watch over their fields while they weren’t around. In modern times, the preferred solution is to simply coat the crops in pesticide which are highly effective at deterring Isfžr, but are mostly harmless to Deorians, Ni̤fra̤v, and most common farm animals.  The pesticide can be washed off after harvesting by simply soaking the harvested grains in water for a few hours.  This is typically done before the grain is sold or used.",

Notable deeds done on the forum are numerous, such as their many terrorist hunts on the /th/ thread, and many, many \"Pranks\" pulled on prominent citizens, usually causing disarray.  Manymoon is a [!3 Tunnel Site], meaning that the location of its servers are unknown.  Manymoon is run by a head admin and owner known as HolyTay.  Most Manymoon users just refer to him as \"Tay\".\u0000css\n    Manymoon is divided into multiple sections called \"threads\".  The topic of a thread dictates what is discussed and shared there.  The proper way to write a thread's name is to terminate both ends with a forward slash (/) -- for example, a thread called \"internet\" would be shortened to \"net\" written \"/net/\".  Some notable threads are:\n        /main/, for anything -- this thread has no topic restrictions;\n        /build/, for discussing architecture and DIY projects;\n        /videos/, for discussing and sharing full-motion videos;\n        /fiction/, for sharing and discussing fictional material;\n        /pranks/, for planning, executing, and sharing pranks at any scale;\n        /power/, for discussing energy production, use, and sources;\n        /pics/, for sharing interesting photots;\n        /sky/, for discusing space infrastructure, trade, and travel;\n        /bs/, (standing for \"Big State\"), for discussing the broader [!4 GCP] confederal government;\n        /pop/, for discussing popular culture;\n        /qi/, for discussing [!5 magic and qi invocation];\n        /d/, which was originally for debate, but is now more oriented around politics in general;\n        /dc/, for discussing Defence Contracting, mercenary work and the [!6 Order of Paladins];\n        /rel/, for discussing [!7 religions] and religious practices;\n        /news/, for discussing current events and news;\n        /trade/, for arranging deals and exhanges between users;\n        /hdrugs/, standing for \"hard drugs\", for discussing use and production of illegal substances.  Though selling on the thread is prohibited;\n        /drugs/, like /hdrugs/, but only permits posts about mostly-legal substances.\n        /cash/, for discussing finances, investments, and stock trading;\n        /cop/, for discussing crime, and sometimes teaming together to solve cases abroad;\n        /th/, for discussing terrorism, mostly towards preventing acts of terror;\u0000css\n        /net/, for discussing [!8 websites] and [!9 internet culture];\n        /chef/, for discussing food and the culinary arts;\n        /funny/, for posting memes, jokes, and other funny content;\n        /schitt/, which is like /funny/, but mainly revolves around feces as a punchline.  It has a poor reputation;\n        /sport/, for discussing competitive games;\n        /code/, for programming, trouble shooting, and discussion about general-purpose computers;\n        /art/, for discussing, sharing, and drafting visual art;\n        /mm/, for posts about the site itself and requesting creation or archival of threads;\n        /c/, for discussing vehicles;\n        /rp/, for finding partners for tabletop or free-form roleplay;\n        /tay/, HolyTay's, the site owner, thread for blogging and personal use;\n        /cl/, for creating cyphers and constructed languages;\n        /bio/, for discussing biology, medicine, geneology, and genetic engineering;\n        /vivo/, like /bio/, but specifically for discussing differences between lifeforms of different [!10 vivotypes];\n        /tunes/, for discussing, sharing, and making music and sound;\n        /lewd/, for discussing general erotica.  More specific erotica threads are /toys/, /cute/, /erp/, /cogniz/, /hot/, /sleek/, /dom/, /skin/, /fluff/, /toons/, and other threads with explicit names.\n        State-oriented threads like /ar/, /bt/, /eq/, /ga/, /gm/, /it/, /lf/, /su/, /ty/, and /ur/ for discussing [!11 Armalai], [!12 Bius Tu], [!13 Deoria], [!14 Gallea], [!15 Ghillymede], [!16 Itascus], [!17 La`Foy], [!18 Solar Union], [!19 New Tyventia], and [!20 Neo Urra] respectively;\n        And countless threads for minor subcultures and interests, from both on or off of the internet.\u0000css\n    There are hundreds of threads on Manymoon, each of which being further divided into \"Topics\" that discuss a specific instance of something, like a specific person, event, building, item, or location.  Manymoon is most popular among [!21 Unil]-speaking users, but, being an interstellar service, contains posts in hundreds of different languages.  For this, users can filter and sort threads by language.\n    Every thread has its own rules and moderation team.  Admins of threads are assigned by HolyTay, Manymoon`s owner, himself, and admins of threads can assign moderators under them.  These admins and moderators typically choose to keep themselves entirely anonymous.\n        \n    While Manymoon`s minimal moderation and general \"lawlessness\" is paraded by its users, who are sometimes called \"Moonies\", outsiders view it as problematic.  While total anonymity and minimal restrictions is thought to be the pinacle of expressing one`s Free Speech, that doesn`t mean its without its problems; Manymoon, and some of its users, has been critisized for allowing commonly toxic, regressive, and hurtful ideas to propogate.  For some examples:\n        multiple hatecrimes across the galaxy have been directly linked to discussions on /rel/, /bio/, and /d/;\n        intentional misinformation campaigns have been directed on /news/, /d/, and /pranks/;\n        distribution of variably-legal pornography on /lewd/ and /cogniz/;\n        /schitt/ is notorious for discussing various, unpopular feces-related pranks in the real world, such as the \"pooball incident\" at a college-level [!22 Spoofball] tourney on [!16 Itascus];\n        normalizing and advocating for dangerous or harmful sexualities on /toys/, /cogniz/, /toons/, and /cute/;\n        /pranks/ and /schitt/ defecating on the driveway or vehicle of notorious politicians on multiple occasions;\n        and objectification of marginal groups on /fluff/, /skin/, and /sleek/;\u0000css\n    As stated previously, however, while this anonymity enables people to gather and carry out acts of malice and chaos, it also enables them to carry out acts generally considered to be ethical and justified (even if illegal).  Some examples of these include:\n        /qi/ has made many discoveries regarding [!23 Qi Energy] that incrementally advanced the art of spellcraft;\n        users on /bio/ have managed to solve archeological mysteries across the galaxy;\n        /th/ actively hunts down terrorist organizations by examining images, video, and reports available on the internet, as well as directing users in areas effected by terror groups to act as investigators and procure important information.  When the group gathers impactful intel, its shared on the thread and with local athourities;\n        /cop/ has helped solve countless crimes by examining public evidence and crowdsourcing the tracking and identification of suspects, similar to /th/;\n        some users on /news/ make it their duty to fact check politicians and talking heads in an effort to fight misinformation;\n        /code/ and /sky/ worked together to organize tens of thousands of Moonies to connect their personal computers to work in tandem and act as one decentralized supercomputer.  This supercomputer was used to run simulated experiments, the results of which were used to increase the efficiency of space ship components.\u0000css\n    Manymoon started as a domestic [!24 Eriian] website at the address [!1 ER.MANYMOON] by a user who goes by \"HolyTay\" (commonly refered to as just \"Tay\").  According to Tay, Manymoon was created as a response to being banned from an unnamed social media in the year 81 for \"unpopular opinions\".  Manymoon`s servers were originally hosted on Erii, in HolyTay`s own home.  In 83, as Manymoon surpassed 5,500 daily active users and Tay`s home hardware was becomming stressed by the activity, he made a choice to start accepting paid ads in order to maintain more powerful hardware.  The Manymoon community was originally outraged by this news, but quickly accepted it as they noted the greatly improved performance of the previously-unreliable site.  From there, Manymoon`s popularity exploded, and Tay found himself with an enormous amount of income.\n    At the same time, Manymoon began drawing ire from news outlets and authorities alike due to the criminal activity being openly discussed and even planned on the site.  Tay was given a Court Order from an [!24 Eriian] high court stating that Manymoon should be moderated to remove all illegal content, as well as limit hate speech.  Tay reluctantly agreed, but openly detested the decision on the /tay/ thread, arguing that it was a blow to the rights (specifically of Free Speech) of people on the site, to which many Moonies agreed.  \n    Shortly after censorship began, Tay bought 117 [!25 quantum nodes], each with one end connected to the Manymoon servers; the other ends of these nodes were distributed across all populated worlds in the GCP.  Tay claimed that this was to improve connectivity to Manymoon, so that users could connect to the site through a proxy no matter where they were, instead of users having to connect to Manymoon through their ISP.  Many ISPs at the time charged a premium for galactic internet access, meaning that people that didn`t live on Erii might have to pay extra in order to access Manymoon.\u0000css\n    After Manymoon installed Quantum Nodes everywhere, the site experienced another explosion in popularity, as then anyone in [!2 Silver Stream] could access Manymoon at no added cost.  This also caused the volume of ad purchases on the site to skyrocket, leading to greater profits for the site.   However, it would soon be revealed that this enhanced availability was not the purpose of the quantum nodes.  On the 31st of Siltcrest, 84 P.W., Manymoon unexpectedly went down.  Attempting to access the website would just show a page with the following message:\n        \"Manymoon is down, but not for long.\n        Starting today, our tongues are untied; we will no longer be censoring our users.\n        Individual threads will still have their own rules, but we will not be bound by laws and court orders intended to silence diverse thought.\n        No longer will Erii, nor any government, control our minds and dictate our words.\n        \n        Stay tuned.\"\n        \n    Seeing that the intentions stated in the message were in direct contradiction to HolyTay`s court order, authorities were quickly alerted, and officers were dispatched to check on him.  However, when they arrived at his residence, he was nowhere to be found, and Manymoon`s server hardware was gone.  His neighbors were questioned, and they described an unmarked van arriving at the residence the day prior.  They claim to have seen Tay and two unidentified [!26 Tuines] loading computer racks into the van, with Tay himself entering the van before all three drove off.  All attempts to track HolyTay down resulted in dead ends, and it is suspected that Tay had left the planet entirely.\u0000css\n    The next day, Manymoon went back online, only being able to be connected to through one of the 117 quantum nodes.  Now that the location of Tay and the Manymoon servers were completely unknown, Manymoon was effectively above litigation.  Many jurisdictions tried to block the site`s address on their worlds, but this wasn`t effective enough due to the number of redundant quantum nodes and proxies.  As the site entered a legal limbo, many advertizers pulled their ads from Manymoon.  Some advertizers did stay, however, maintaining income for the site.\n    Today, Manymoon is more popular than ever, and the whereabouts of HolyTay are still unknown.  When discussing his living situation on the /tay/ thread, HolyTay claims he lives in \"a 50-room underground mansion with a pool\" -- this has been confirmed by pictures he shares to his thread.",

        "data": "css\n    Unlike most other governments in the [!1 GCP], [!2 Gallea] has a very regimented space traffic protocal that adds on to that of other GCP nations.  This system is known as the Gallean Space Traffic and Threat Detection System, or \"STTDS\".  This system was created during the [!3 Armament Era of Gallean history] in the year 52 as a toggleable modification of transmitters standard to the GCP at that time.  Transmissions sent from these units are encrypted and all documents regarding it’s specific details are confidential and classified to the general public.  A STTDS transponder turns on and transmits automatically when within Gallean space.  \n\n    The STTDS transmitter must be turned on within Gallean space, and lawfully required on all ships sold, flown into, or manufactured in Gallean space and territories.  All ships detected without it are to be inspected immediately and failure to report in for inspection will incur hefty fines or even impoundment of the vessel.  If a ship is detected in Gallean Space without one of these transponders, it will be forced to land/dock, and cannot legally take off until the transponder is installed.  If the ship owner refuses to install a STTDS transponder, they are required to remain grounded indefinitely or leave the Gallean jurisdiction entirely.\u0000css\n    The workings of the STTDS system that are known to the public work by a series of Radar/Radio stations within Gallean space ping every single ship detected, the ping then turns on the transmitter if off and it sends information to the station, said station then transmits it to relays(if needed), that then bring the signal to Gallean data servers that monitor every single ship within Gallean Space.  Data known to be transmitted by STTDS transponders includes: [!4 Callsign], ship model, current heading, verified destination, Gallean registration, age, name of the ship, crew count, cargo description, date of last inspection, spacial location, and even reactor status (if applicable).  \n\n    A STTDS system must be installed at a Gallean forward registration location on foreign planets and stations en route to Gallean space.  Said system can be installed at 0 cost to the owners of a ship, at the expense of the Gallean Government.\n\n    Any tampering of the STTDS transponder within a ship, upon detection, will result in an emergency ping, which will be picked up by any relay station in range.  This is because STTDS system hardware is a state secret of the Gallean State.",

However, while maintaining quality, it stockpiles large amounts of near-cutting-edge weapons as well as training soldiers and officers to do 2 ranks above themselves.  For example, promising privates recive training in some skills usually reserved for captains or commanders in addition to normal training, so that they may more smoothly fill those positions as the military ranks are expanded.

Most Gallean numbers are unknown and confidential leaving it’s true size to speculation.  The Branch has sub branches Government Guard, Frontier Guard, Military Police, the Back Guard, Air Guard, and the Strategic Strike Group.  The branch can expand during wartime to include an Army Corps sub branch that would be manned by the officers of the Strategic Strike Group.  \n\n    The Government Guard is the Elite force of the Land Command which protects and Guards government buildings, facilities, monuments, and landmarks.  Each section is a Contingent made of 5-10k Galleans, Contingents are split into Sector Patrol made up of 2,500 Galleans.  Each Patrol is divided into Defense Groups made up of 500 Galleans each.  Each of these Defense Groups are divided by Battalions of 100 each.  Battalions are then divided by squads of 10 which can be each specialized to the needs of the battalion.  \n    The Frontier Guard are the primary peacekeepers of frontier worlds.  Toughened and rough, these enforcers usually work in squads of 5 to 1.  They operate under frontier commands that vary on the planet, population, geography, and necessity.  The Military police are the police of every branch, they root out corruption, unethical behavior, treason, and even war crimes.  This branch mostly works in divisions that are comprised of 5,000 operatives, and have subdivisions of 1,000 each known as Subversion Detection groups.  These will then be divided into groups of 100 that are attached to other branches known as Squadrons.\u0000css\n    The Back Guard is the logistical core of any GLC operation.  There are few specified structures of this branch, as it follows the most flexible doctrine of all the branches.  Its divided into 1,000-member corps of Gallean operatives, specified and reorganized to any needed necessity for a current or planned operation.  Some corps are engineer corps, logistic corps, transport corps, etc..\n    The Air Guard is the Air Supremacy division of the Land Command and oversees all terrestrial air operations.  The largest section of Air Guard is 100-vehicle wings, comprised of 20 5-vehicle squadrons.  Perhaps the simplest of all the branches, it uses time-proven tactics to effectively gain supremacy, commit ground support, decimate supply lines and infrastructure, and protect the boots on the ground.  \n\n    Strategic Strike Group is the most varied of all subbranches of the LC, It contains the Armor Corps, and the Strategic offense Corps.  This entire section can be expanded into the Army Corps during times of full war.  The Armor Corps is made of multiple Corps, with 5-10 divisions each.  Divisions are made up of ~4,000 vehicles each.  That 4,000 is split with 1,000 Strategic groups, every 100 of those are split into battalions.  Battalions are split into groups of specific vehicles, with each one containing having a different cast of military or logistical vehicles.  The Strategic Offense Corps is composed of many subcorps, which are separated into divisions of about 50,000 Soldiers.  Those divisions are separated into 10,000-soldier Battle Groups.  Groups can be separated into 1,000 strong Legions.  100 soldier platoons make up those Legions.  Platoons are then separated into squads of 10.",

        "data": "css\n    The Gallean Fleet Command (domestically referred to as the Grand Fleet Command) is the main arm of the military and enforces the rule of law in Gallean space.  This branch fills three roles in space: policing, defense, and offense.  The sub branches of the Galactic Fleet Command are as follows:  The Law Enforcement Armada, Planetary Guard, Astroport Defense Guard, and The Strategic Armada.\n\n    The Law Enforcement Armada is the policing arm of the GFC and performs day-to-day patrols of every [!1 trade circuit] and the enforcement of the [!2 TTDS] system.  The exact structure of enforcers in each sector of Gallean space is different, but most sector patrols keep a similar structure.  Each Sector has multiple patrol subsections, a patrol contains a corvette and multiple gunships, often accompanied by squadrons of interceptors.\n    The Planetary Guard act as the defense garrison of a given Gallean planet.  They provide assistance to ships in trouble within the sphere of influence of the planet they serve, as well as protecting against smuggling and piracy, which is their primary responsibility during peacetime.  Each planet within the Gallean jurisdiction has 15-40 active Patrol Ships in orbit at any given moment.  Patrol groups usually consist of a single destroyer, with a docked fighter-interceptor as an escort or boarding ship.\n    The Astroport Defense Guard is the GFC contingent in charge of the protection of public and government [!3 Astroports].  There are currently about 20 Galleat Garrisons footsoldiers, dedicated to defending Astroports, with each heavily-trafficked Astroport housing a contingent of 1-6 fighters for protection.  Little is publicly known about this sub-branch.\u0000css\n    The Strategic Armada is the largest of all sub-branches in the GFC and has a \"quality over quantity\" approach when it comes to capital ships, but a \"quantity over quality\" approach when it comes to smaller fighters.  The Strategic Armada branch has 3 publicly-disclosed fleets.  In each fleet there are: 1-7 fighters carriers, 1-2 dreadnoughts, 1-3 Battle Cruisers, 1-2 Heavy Cruisers, and 1-4 Light Cruisers.  Each fleet has a complement of 40-100 small fighter craft and/or atmospheric bombers (primarily concentrated within the fleet`s carriers), capable of swarming enemy fleets.   Strike craft and bombers dropped into the atmosphere from spacecraft follow the same protocols as the Air Guard of the [!4 Gallean Land Command].  These three fleets are named \"Fleet Shadow\", \"Fleet Obsidian\", and \"Fleet Magma\".  The Strategic Armada follows a doctrine of strategic carrier supremacy, each carrier can split its carried fleet into organized, offensive strike groups.  The reason for the Strategic Armada’s size is due to the [!5 Armament Era] in which the shipyards of Gallea were in full throttle and it expanded the navy that was barely able to keep ganeimede into a titan of space.",

        "data": "css\n    Ichor is an energy-dense, artificial fluid invented as a high-power fuel source.  Ichor is primarily used in large spacecraft, especially in those which make use of [!1 heavy laser weaponry] or large [!2 warp drives].  This is because Ichor can be used to generate a large amount of power in a small amount of time.\n    \n    Ichor is a compound Consisting of, listed from highest to lowest concentration, Silicon, Oxygen, Iodine, Cesium, Bismuth, and [!3 Aptha].  Ichor typically comes in a fluid form, but can be manufactured as a solid when additional Silicon and small amounts of Carbon are added to the formative mixture.  Ichor's energy density is about 344 kilojoules per gram (which is about 10.489 [!4 chells] per gram), which is the highest out of any known non-nuclear energy source.  It has a density of 6.832 grams per cubic centimeter, a viscosity of 3,520 centipoise (if in liquid form), a hardness close to that of chalk (in in solid form), and a very dark-green coloration.  At standard market value, Ichor sells for $30 [!5 ITC] per kilogram.\n    \n    Ichor can be burned/oxygenated, but this only releases about 30% of its energy.  Ichor burns violently and at high tempuratures, making open flames near Ichor containers a serious risk for explosions or meltdowns.  Burning Ichor leaves behind \"Ichor Ash\", a pale, blue-green coarse powder; and \"Ichor Soot\", a dark, fine powder.  The Ichor Ash contains the remaining 70% of the Ichor's energy, but accessing it is difficult, and melting Ichor Ash back down into Raw Ichor is a hazardous, expensive process, so Ichor Ash is usually Discarded.  Ichor Soot is entirely inert, and can be recycled back into the Ichor production process.\u0000css\n    Ichor is produced by heating the constituent materials to about 1,900 degrees, mixing until the material is homogenous, and then cooling it.  In this form, it's called \"Raw Ichor\".  Raw Ichor is a lime-green, thin fluid, and is mostly inert and slightly flammable.  Raw Ichor is then \"baked\" in a low-tempurature \"oven\" with a very high concentration of [!4 Qi-Energy].  Baked Ichor, just called \"Ichor\", is its useful form, and is a dark-green, thick liquid.  Ichor takes a large amount of energy to be baked.\n\n    Ichor is stable, having a half-life of about 54 [!6 Galactic Years] (at room tempurature).  As Ichor decays, it releases 76.9% of its energy in the form of [!3 charged qi particles], about 0.54% in the form of high-wavelength EM radiation, and the other 22.56% in the form of heat.  Normally, decay does not cause a chain reaction.  However, Ichor's stability decreases dramatically as its tempurature and pressure increases.  At 1,100 degrees celsius or above, Ichor becomes unstable enough that the heat caused by its decay is enough to maintain a self-sustaining decay reaction.  This tempurature is called the \"Critical Point\".  At or above this point, the tempurature of the decaying ichor must be regulated, otherwise a meltdown is imminent.  As Ichor reacts and decays, it turns into 83% Ichor Soot, 15% Ichor Ash, and 2% Raw Ichor by mass.  These biproducts are usually discarded, but are sometimes sold back to Ichor manufacturers to be refined and recycled back into Ichor.\u0000css\n    Ichor is used in Ichor Reactors to produce an immense amount of energy in a small amount of time.  A small Ichor Reactor, taking up usually appoximately 4 cubic meters, is able to produce up to 6 megawatts, while a large Ichor Reactor, fitting in up to 30 cubic meters, can produce 400 megawatts of power.  Ichor Reactors generate energy by placing a small amount of Ichor in a small, hardened, qi-conductive, pressure-resistant chamber.  This chamber is then heated up to cause the Ichor to decay.  As the Ichor decays and gives off Qi Energy, that Qi Energy is picked up by the chamber walls and can then be used.  The waste heat produced by the reactor chamber can also be used to boil water and spin turbines to generate [!7 electrical energy], similar to traditional power generators.  Standard Ichor reactors take 40 to 70 seconds to heat up the reactor chamber to approprate tempuratures.\n    There are two kinds of Ichor Reactor, \"Cold Ichor Reactors\" and \"Hot Ichor Reactors\".  \"Cold\" Ichor Reactors keep the tempurature of the Ichor in the reactor chamber high, but under the Critical Point.  While this produces less power per gram of Ichor per second, the risk of meltdown is very low, and the reactor only requires a moderate amount of cooling.  \"Hot\" Ichor Reactors, however, heat the Ichor in the reactor chamber beyond the critical point, which kicks off the dangerous, but highly-efficient chain reaction.  Since the Ichor in a Hot Ichor Reactor chamber is beyond its critical point, it will continue to get hotter and hotter as it releases more and more energy, meaning that Hot Ichor Reactors must actively cool the chamber to keep the tempurature of the reacting Ichor from surpassing that of the melting point of the Chamber's material.\u0000css\n    Many Modern Hot Ichor Reactors are able to detect an imminent meltdown, and are built to automatically jettison the contents of the reactor chamber once the Ichor inside reaches a certain tempurature.  Usually, the reactor chamber opens a value to a pipe which leads outside of the structure housing the reactor.  As the Ichor is vented, its pressure sharply decreases to the ambient pressure of the environment, which quickly decreases its tempurature.  After this, the jettisoned Ichor will either continue to react in open air (or space), or have been cooled down enough by the pressure change to dip below the critical point and stop the chain reaction.\n    \n    Ichor was originally invented in 36 P.W. on the planet [!8 Bius Tu] as a high-density fuel source.  The full name of Ichor is \"Ichor-38\", as the modern mixture of Ichor was the 38th draft of the formula made by the Tuine science team that invented it.  Because of this, for abbreviation, Ichor is sometimes referred to as just \"38\".",

Both domestically, and abroad, it is one of the poster children of Urran Brutalism; a minimalist architectural style where the building materials and structural elements of the buildings are left bare.  As such, the city makes heavy use of concrete, glass and timber in its structures.\n\n    The city is organised in concentric circles, the largest being 30km in diameter, with a 1km arcology at the center, housing the administrative district of the planet.  This Arcology is made from steel-reinforced concrete, with a wooden spire constructed on top.  It has a volume of 531,000 cubic meters and is a hive of administrative activity, with thousands of workers coming every day to the tower.  The skyline of the city forms forms a bell shape when seen from afar, with the administrative center in the middle, and buildings getting progressively smaller as they get further from the city center.\u0000css\n    A [!2 skyrail] system link the center to the periphery in a cross pattern and six circles around the center.  But these skyrails have failed commercially due to the high cost of the tickets and expensive maintenance, which was exacerbated by the low population.  The denizens of Antaria mostly use the roads, by car, bus, bike, or just on foot.\n    \n    The city was originally planned to house 6 million inhabitants, but most Kayanites found the \"raw\" look of the city unappealing, leading to a cascading effect where the low appeal of the city would cause a lowered population, which, in turn, would have a harder time supporting the large number of commercial services present in the city, which would further lower the appeal of Antaria even more.\n    Today, the city is disproportionately inhabited by government officials managing the planet and [!3 Neo-Urran] state programs; large sections of the city are left uninhabited for years at a time, as residents tend to bunch together.",

As the Homeworld of the [!1 Tyvant race], it had been colonised and civilized since ancient times, and was the capital world of [!2 Tyventia] until this status was transferred to [!3 Quaen] in 82.  The Planet does not experience differing seasons due to its very low Obliquity.  The planet’s land mass is divided into six major continents which represent 19% of the surface area of the planet.  An additional 3% of the surface consists of small islands and scattered landmasses, meaning a total 22% of the planet`s surface is land, with the other 78% being water.\n    \n    Due to the absence of seasons and weak marine currents, the temperature across the planet is mostly constant, which the average temperature of any point on the surface being almost entirely determined by its latitude; most of the landmasses near the equator are desert or savannah, while extreme (near-polar) latitudes are tundras and ice deserts.  One peculiarity of the planet is its coastlines -- while most its coasts are irregular, some other parts form a warped yet quasi-perfect arc.  Simulations of the continental drift have led to the theory that all of the landmasses of kayan were arranged in an almost-perfect circle two supercontinents ago.\u0000css\n    The planet is densely-populated due to being a homeworld for the [!1 Tyvant species], and is at the center of the trade routes in the Tyventian sector.  It was for this very reason that after the loss of Urra, the Neo Urran empire has chosen Nastimye as its new capital, this was at this time that The name was changed, in order to help the transition, from its old tyventian identity to its new Neo Urran one.     The planet has a thriving mining industry due to abundant concentrations of iron oxide, titanium, gold, aphta, aluminium and other ores in a geological layer dating from approximately 620 million year ago, which is present almost everywhere on the planet.\n\n    Under Tyventan rule, Nastimye was the capital of the very-centralised Tyventian empire, and as such hosted a vibrant economy.  The heavy concentration of useful materials in the planet's soil helped fuel the expansion of the empire, which, was the largest single nation in the [!4 Silver Stream] by territory (number of planets).  After the invasion of 82, the planet was the economic barycenter of the [!5 Urran Empire] due to the amount of infrastructure already in place.  After 5 years of recession caused by the annexation, the planetary economy restarted its growth.  And finally, after the Battle of Armalai and the empire's loss of [!6 Planetary Urra], the planet became the capital of an empire again and large efforts have been undertaken to get the administrative infrastructures of the planet to work as a capitol again.",

Kastrataco was originally formed in 84 as a conglomerate of all Kayanese mining companies, forcibly nationalized by the occupying Urran Empire.  Despite being a company, Kastrataco is owned by the local Neo-Urran government, which receives dividends from the mining activities.

At this time, it was the main tool used by the regime to distribute its propaganda.  The group currently own several radio stations and two television channels.  These television channels are Urra One, available across the broader [!3 GCP] for free; and Urra Two (previously \"Urra Four\"), a channel available across [!1 Neo-Urran] worlds.  On Urra Two, roughly 1/3 of daily content is for and about the planet where it is aired, while the rest is broader national, or galactic news.  While being intentionally made available to the rest of the GCP, UBC programming is banned in many jurisdictions, including [!4 Deoria], [!5 Bius Tu], and [!6 Gallea].\n    \n    An Urra Two station was present on Itascan-Controlled Planetary Urra at two different instances.  Each time, the station was destroyed by civilian activists, with the first being the wood-frame Urra Two station being burnt down in 102, and the second being knocked down by a civilian bulldozer truck in 106.  In both of these instances, there were no fatalities, and the civilian activists were not prosecuted beyond disorderly conduct charges.\u0000css\n    During the [!2 Jacob] years, the title of CEO of the UBC was a very prestigious one, due to the importance of propaganda in the [!1 Urran Empire], and most CEOs of the group either had been or were going to be Urran Ministers of Information.\n\n    The group peaked in 102, just before the [!7 battle of Armalai], being the only TV group in the Empire and owning five channels.  But, after the disappearance of [!2 Karmine Jacobs] and the secession of [!8 New Tyventia], the UBC had entered a slow decline, only drawing a significant audience in [!1 Neo Urra] and even there having lost the monopoly. Two years after the Battle, The UBC has announced the end of their second, third and fifth television channels because of their dwindling audience.\n    The group is allegedly in deep financial trouble according to internal sources, due to the lack of revenue from its channels and the high production value of their content, which was previously subsidised by the government.  The company also has a public relation problem, often being seen as the “voice of the dictatorship” and it is rumored that a rebranding may be on the way.",

The ammunition was developed during the post armalai fleet modernization program by Kinetyx as an anti-armor weapon.\n\n    When the ammunition is fired, the target is acquired and the shell starts correcting its trajectory.  When it arrives at a predefined distance from the target, a small charge inside the shell explodes and the 61 tungsten rods separate from the main body and hit the target with dozens of unique entry points, almost guaranteed to hit at least one vital system on the target.  The rods themselves are optimized for penetration, with a length of 50 cm and a diameter of 2 cm, they can penetrate over one meter of steel armor, while most ships only have around 30 cm of protective plating.\n\n    The shell corrects its trajectory using a hybrid-fuel engine using a nitrous oxide oxidizer and a rubber fuel.  With the oxidizer being a liquid and the rubber a solid, this system allows for a higher engine efficiency and finer control than a solid-fuel rocket, while also being cheaper than a liquid-fuel engine.  The expected total burn time is about ten seconds, allowing continuous guidance for targets up to 40 kms away.\n\n    The spread of the rods can be controlled by timing the detonation of the internal charge, the radius of dispersion evolving linearly with the distance to the target when the shell is detonated, which this distance usually being between 1 and 10 kilometers.",

Two variants of the kayan exist, called Type-A and Type-B. the type A was the first to be produced and can be found in both the neo urran and new tyventian navies, it features two cannons, the type B started production in 103 and replaced one cannon with a laser.  Both types feature two [!3 Antaria turrets], fitted with 100mm cannons on the Type A but with one of them being equipped with a 10MW laser on the Type B.  These turrets are complemented by eight 1.3x1.3x4.5m VLS missile tubes. \n\n    Its compact package is made possible by the use of mercury-based thrusters, which combine a relatively-high ISP of 5000s with a high thrust and a compact fuel.  The two mercury thrusters are positioned orthogonally from one another, allowing for unpredictable evasive maneuvers.  The main thruster can output 150MN of thrust (a 3G burn) while the smaller ventral thruster outputs 75 MN of thrust (1.5G burn).\u0000css\n    Life aboard a Kayan is organised in three rotating shifts of 8h. The crew is divided in three pairs of one pilot and one mechanic who perform their work shifts at the same time and sleep at the same time in the two dormitories.  This allows for the continuous operation of the ship and saves volume and weight that would've been taken up by additional cabins, since the two-bed rooms are only occupied by a third of the crew at a time.  The pair system allows for better performance and crew bonding, since the crew members get used to working with their partner.  In case of a crisis (a combat situation, for example), the off-duty and sleeping pairs can be called on in order to help.  And at the end of each shift, the captain (which is one of the pilots) meets the pair ending and the pair starting a shift in order to maintain situational awareness and give orders.\n\n    The ship's defense is divided in several layers in order to maximize survivability; the farthest threats (up to a few hundred light milliseconds away) are dealt with by the laser when equipped, which is sufficiently cooled to function continuously at 10MW.  When targets are a few dozen kilometers from the ship, the 20 self defense missiles become an option, and can be used to destroy other missiles and projectiles or be used as a swarm, overwhelming an enemy’s point defense grid and crippling the ship.  When the range drops below 20 km, the cannon becomes a powerful tool and can be used either offensively or defensively.  The kayan uses two reactive armor pods which can explode into a cloud of debris in order to destroy one or more projectiles which would have slipped through the defensive grid.  It can also divert missiles and radar readings using chaff and flares.\u0000css\n    All of the fleet’s point defense assets and information are synchronized in a network in order to increase situational awareness and cover blind spots. The kayan’s radars also have the ability to form an interferometry network in order to increase the range of detection and resolution of the enemy positions.\n\n    The kayan’s passive armor follows an all-or-nothing philosophy: \n        - The whole ship is protected by two layers of Titanium armor -- the outermost layer has a height of 5 cm and is coated in a radar absorbing paint.  Under this first layer, and separated from it by a void of 25 cm, lies a second layer of titanium armor, 45 cm high and made as reflective as possible.  This second layer is designed to stop projectiles from penetrating any part of the ship, but more importantly, to protect against lasers with a sub-X-ray particle energy.\n\n        - Under the first layer of armor, the most vital parts of the ship (command and information center, ammunition magazine(s), energy generation, engine and warp drive) benefit from a second layer of defense -- a pair of two 35-cm thick layers of reflective titanium armor, separated by the ship`s mercury tanks, protect these parts against more energetic projectiles.  They are complemented on the sides by the two 50KL mercury tanks which, thanks to the high density of their content, can act as a layer of liquid armor.\u0000css\n    The ship can fulfill a diverse set of missions: \n        - Combat, Escort, Harassment and Patrol missions: these are the main applications for the Kayan-Class Corvette.  A group of Kayans can form a pack and take down enemy ships larger than themselves with their missiles.  Its turreted laser, self defense missiles, and cannon are also very effective against smaller targets, allowing it to destroy enemy fighters and missiles, effectively adding itself to the point defense grid of a larger ship.  The ship`s autonomy, along with the rotating crew of six, allows the Kayan to function continuously and perform guard or anti-piracy missions alone.\n\n        - Reconnaissance missions: the Kayan can use its powerful sensor suite, autonomy, small cross section, and stealth oriented-design to detect and report enemy activities.  \n\n        - Finally, Strategic Deterrence missions: the corvette can use its warp drive and large VLS tubes to deliver up to eight nuclear-tipped missiles far into enemy territory. \n\n\n    The corvette represents the backbone of the [!4 Neo Urran] Fleet where it numbers in the thousands to hundreds of thousands.  The ship is the product of the Imperial Urran Naval doctrine of relying on a large number of small, mobile, and expendable spacecrafts in order to overwhelm an enemy defenses, and denying them any target of significant size.  Type-A kayans can also be found in New Tyventia, but due to celesse centered-production for models of the Kayan, the New Tyventian state only has a few hundred Kayans, and need to cannibalise some of them for spare parts.  The main combat action of the kayan class was during [!5 The battle of Armalai], where they were, along with the nero fighter, at the core of the Urran task force.  But despite an impressive performance from the class, the Urran fleet was outnumbered and outgunned by the full might of the gcp which had been given the Urran battle plan through Itascus.\u0000css\n    The ship entered its design phase in 93, and was supposed to be a heavier ship to complement the nero fighters and take on bigger ships in packs.  It entered production in 97, and by 102, a few dozen thousand had been produced.  After the [!5 Battle of Armalai], Larger Urran ships were produced and the role of the Kayan shifted more toward point defense and recon.\n\n    The Kayan Corvette is assembled in orbit of Kosh and [!6 planet Kayan], where the hull, which has been casted in two parts (front and aft), is outfitted with the interior walls and components.  Then, the two parts are cold-welded together.  Once the hull has been found to be airtight, the turrets are mounted and tested.  The subsystems of the craft are then tested. the ship receives a unique identification number made of six base36 characters (0-9 and A-Z, ex: \"KZ3E4F\") and are assigned to a crew which has the right to name it.  The parts for the Kayan are mostly sourced from the [!7 Celesse system], in order to mitigate the risk of enemy raids on production facilities.  The biggest contractors work in close cooperation with the state and are [!8 Celesse Shipyards], [!9 Kinetyx], [!1 Ganoder], [!10 Urran Life Support Systems Company] and [!11 Vella Optics].  This centralisation has also prevented New Tyventia from building new kayan class ships.\u0000css\n    Changelog(by year): \n        103 - The Kayan Type-B model entered production, where the ventral cannon of the Kayan had been replaced with a 10MW laser, and a third Ichor reactor has been added, replacing the magazine below the turret.  Due to these changes, the Kayan Type-B cost the equivalent of 1.045 Billion Kars ($209 Million ITC) while the Kayan Type-A only cost 880 million ($176 million ITC).  Today, the Kayan Type-B is the most prevalent form of the craft, while the Type-A is mostly restricted to larger battlegroups.\n\n        104 - The titanium armor on all Neo-Urran Kayans was replaced by an equivalent volume of graphene-reinforced titanium-aluminium alloy.  The resulting armor is stronger but only has 80% of the original volumic mass. \n\n        The outermost layer of titanium was replaced by a layer of copper of the same weight, coated in graphene sheets of approximately 1m^2 each, produced by the deposition of a carbon-rich vapor on a copper substrate.  While reducing the resistance of the ship to kinetic impacts, it also greatly enhances its resistance to lasers. Due to the extremely high thermal conductivity of graphene, the heat is drawn away from the impact point and mitigates local vaporization of the armor. The heat is then transferred from the graphene layer to the copper layer due to the high conductivity of copper. The result is a layer of armor which only fails when the whole block of copper reaches 2200C, which is the temperature of disintegration of the covalent bonds in graphene.\n\n\n\nThe following information is valid for a Year 103 Type-B Kayan.\u0000css\n\nComponent breakdown (Front to Back):\n\nComponent Name                                   Manufacturer   Mass      Widest Part Length

        "data": "css\n    A Coefficient Node Matrix (CNM) is a type of algorithm/data model which can effectively self-generate.  It is used in domains where traditional expert software development produces unreliable results or isn’t deemed cost effective.  Coefficient Node Matrixes, when used to make problem-solving AI, are called \"Generated Intelligences\".\n\n    This is why the technology is so useful; when a problem is too big or too complex for a human to design a solution to, a node matrix can mutate itself into a solution for the problem instead.  The largest biggest users of these matrices are search engines, speech or software designed to recognise speech, images, handwritten text or other patterns and the autopilots of various vehicles because of the complexity of these kinds of algorithm.    \n\n    In more brief terms, an initial, empty matrix acts as a blank template from which a specific algorithm can evolve.  Though this evolution, one can generate a novel solution to a particular problem without human design.  This matrix can be understood as a network of variables, the “nodes” linked together in layers by mathematical functions called “lines”.  Since CNMs are similar in function to biological brains, \"nodes\" and \"lines\" are sometimes called \"neurons\" and \"axons\" respectively.\u0000css\n    The input data is fed into the neurons of the first layer, then each subsequent layer transforms the input data by multiplying it with parameters and adding biases before sending it to the next. the output can then be read in the neurons of the last layer.  The last layer is the output of the matrix, and is what outputs generated material, commands to hardware, or the answer to the question asked of the CNM.  These networks are generally very resource-intensive due to the sheer amount of calculations required between neurons.  These processes are almost exclusively sped up using special chips, where the nodes and paths are physically on the circuitry, requiring much less computing power than simulating each component on a processor.\n\n    This whole matrix can be seen as a singular, huge mathematical function, with thousands of parameters which transform the input layer into the output layers.  But in order to solve a problem, the CNM must first be trained.  In order to train a CNM, you require a data set which contains a collection of parameters to be fed into the CNM, as well as the answer key for each group of parameters.  Ex: if you wanted to train a CNM to differentiate between images of space ships and airplanes, you data set should contain many images of both spaceships and airplanes, with each image being tagged with the answer as to whether it's a ship or a plane.  The larger and more diverse your data set, the more accurate and versatile your network will be at the end of training.\u0000css\n    The parameters to be input into these networks can mainly be found in two ways, Supervised Learning or Unsupervised Learning.\n    In Supervised Learning, we feed the matrix with example data; for each example, the weights and biases of the matrix are tweaked in order to make it provide a more correct answer.  The network can then be tested with new examples to see if the tweaks made the system more accurate.  If so, the changes are kept, and the process repeats.  This specific process of Supervised Learning is called \"Mutation\".\n\n    Unsupervised Learning is a lot like Supervised Learning, but instead of one instance of a CNM network, you have several in a group called a \"set\".  In every iteration of the set, some number of the most fit (as in the best) CNM configurations are kept while the rest are culled.  The vacant slots are then filled with mutations of the remaining configurations.  This cycle is repeated until the fitness of the strongest matrix is above a certain threshold.  Unsupervised Learning tends to give greater yields than Supervised Learning, but requires orders of magnitude more processing power.\n\n    If a large collection of example data is unavailable, the matrix can be set up with a genetic algorithm made by humans.  The data scientist generates several matrices with random coefficients and then makes them compete on the problem.  The best performing matrices are then mutated (weights and biases in the nodes are randomly adjusted) and the removed matrices are replaced by new matrices stemming from the surviving ones.  After each generation, the matrices will have become more efficient at solving the problem.",

The colony is known for its strong Tyvent identity and culture of democracy.  As of 109PW, the colony counted 860 thousand citizens, mostly concentrated in a narrow strip of land around the terminator of the planet.\n\n    Due to the tidal locking, the colonists don’t experience a natural daylight cycle, living in an eternal dawn instead.  Across most of the planet, they use artificial lighting to simulate one.  Emulating a daylight cycle is an important task for colonies on inhospitable tidally-locked worlds, as it helps maintain the health and work ethic of the colonists.\u0000css\n    The hemisphere of the planet facing the sun is mostly composed of huge, lifeless, scorched deserts of sand and stone, while the one facing away hosts an equally-lifeless frozen ocean.  Living on Neo Nastimye is especially hard due to the constant, unforgiving winds that careen over the surface at over 200 kilometers per hour.  These winds are caused by the atmosphere condensing on the cold face of the planet, then flowing to the hot side to evaporate.  This causes a constant, strong flow of wind from the warm side to the cold side, and a constant flow of freezing atmospheric gasses from the cold side to the warm.  Ships can only land or take off during very short windows where the windspeed drops under 40 kilometers per hour.  While this is a challenge for colonizing, it's a also a challenge to invade, which was a draw for initial colonists who were fearful of an attack from the [!2 Urran Empire].\n\n    The colonists mostly live indoors, in small underground communities where they do their agriculture.  Due to the lack of exports, the small size of the local market, and the isolation of the colony, it is poorer than the average world in the Silver Stream.  The majority of the planet's power comes from wind turbines, which are numerous and fruitful.",

        "data": "css\n    Pre-Kermak Enlightenment, religions were wildly diverse across [!1 Gallea]; it could change from one town to the next, or remain contiguous over entire primitive nations.  There were a few common elements, however: the belief in Volcano deitism, the evil of the Cold, the Righteous Heat, and the Dying of heat into the cold through time as an eternal cycle.  The specifics were disputed for millenia, and in some religions, the Cold was either a neutral, all-encompassing death that all things faded into; or a revenge driven, vengeful monster that consumes life with prejudice. \n \n    Kermak was born into one of the old kingdoms of Gallea in the year -103.  As a young boy, he worked and toiled in the underground farms of [!2 Venisuo].  As a laborer, he would struggle every day to make ends meet, and, from the sources we have, we know he was deeply religious both on and off the fields.  It is important to note that the Gallean Industrial Revolution was happening at the time, and laborers from the new factories and the farms were becoming increasingly socialist in their ideas.  With the Social change around him, Kermak was said to have become more socialist himself.\n\n    Around the time he was 13, the Galleat donated all of his possessions, and begin travelling the world.  This sudden change of lifestyle was spurred on by a vision he experienced at the large dormant Volcano that stood high over the eastern edge of Venisuo.  The vision is said to be the sight of the great old Volcano’s deity directing Kermak himself to bring together the world’s religions under one single religion, for the volcano’s deity is Gearthmeia the father of all volcano deities that bring the Great Warmth to the surface in the never ending cycle of heat and the battle against the dying of the warmth.\u0000css\n    And so began Kermak’s prophetism, after visiting many large cities and small towns, he returned back to Venisuo to found his new religion with 30 Apostles in the Caldera of Gearthmeia in the year -86.  From there, Gearthmeiaism was created and subsequently spread rapidly, while it respected previous traditions of individual tribes (tribes being families and/or large groups that consider each other familial in Gallean society), it also consolidated their beliefs into a single entity, the Church of Gearthmeia.  While more radical tennents like sacrifice of Galleans to volcanoes were weened out, sacrifices of food or other items replaced them.  This was part of a larger trend of lessening Gallea's more radical beliefs in turn for more sustainable and ethical ones, referred to by the church as “Realizing Sustainable Faith”. \n\n    From his church in Venisuo, Kermak was instrumental in the enlightenment of many Galleans across the globe into socialist ideals.  This broad enlightenment is thought to be one of the events that led the world into the [!3 Gallean World War].  The Gallean Republic subsequently formed, and was generally founded on some of Gearthmeiaism’s tennents.  Kermak died in Venisuo in -66 of heart failure, surrounded by his apostles.",

Secondary worlds are about 8 times as numerous as Primary ones.\n    Frontier Worlds are worlds with very minimal inhabitance.  These worlds have less than a million inhabitants, and are typically only in place for mining operations.  These worlds are sometimes even abandoned after mining facilities close, losing up to 95% of their inhabitants to emmigration.  Frontier Worlds typically do not even have a breathable atmosphere.

These four factions have are the result of a recent push among believers to question if the church is on the right path for the future.

It is an individual's fault if they do not fulfil the gift of warmth.

It has an elevation speed of 70 degrees per second and a traverse speed of 120 degrees per second.  The turret's chassis is protected by half a meter of titanium armor and rotated by a 100kw motor.  The cannon's elevation is controlled by an additional 50kw motor in the hull of the turret.  The mounted weapon can elevate from -15 to 85 degrees, which allows for overlapping cones of fire.  Two versions of the turret exist: the Antaria B and the Antaria L.  The Antaria B is equipped with a 100mm Electrothermal Chemical Cannon (abbreviated as an \"ETC Cannon\") while the Antaria L is equipped with a 10MW laser.  \n\n    The Antaria B can fire two types of rounds at a time due to a duplicate-feeding mechanism -- the rounds come from the magazine on two separate belts, and are then fed into the cannon at the demand of the operator, which can seamlessly alternate the between the two sources.  This unique capacity allows for high rates of fire or the ability to use the turret both as a ciws and as an offensive weapon.\u0000css\n    The Antaria L`s laser is mounted on the same place as the cannon would be on the Antaria B, but the belts are replaced by electric cables, and an additional, supplementary [!2 Ichor Reactor] is often installed in the place of the magazine.  This shared form factor allows for simpler logistics and more flexibility in manufacturing, with the two forms of the Antaria having the ability to be produced with the same tooling and factories.\n\n    The rounds in the Electrothermal Chemical Cannon are electrically-ignited using a plasma cartridge.  This method of ignition allows for the use of more energetically-dense propellants (cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine, for example, in the case of the [!1 Kayan]) which can achieve exit velocities of up to 3.2km/s, and improve the predictability of the detonation of the propellant inside the barrel.  The ETC Cannon system also improves the survivability of the ship by preventing internal magazine explosions; if the magazine is hit during combat, an explosion can not detonate the shells because their propellant requires the electrical stimulation of the plasma cartridge in order to explode.\n\n    The most used ammunition for the Antaria on the Kayan is a fragmentation shell, containing 416 2-cm tungsten balls; and a high-explosive filler, detonating after a delay magnetically transmitted to the shell on barrel exit.  This shell, used for CIWS and anti-fighter purposes, is complemented by an APDS (Armor Piercing Discarding Sabot) for harder targets.\n\n    The Antaria turret is named after the capital city of the planet [!3 Kayan], [!4 Antaria].",

For example, a Gallean named Kermak Fermi Anori would just be refered to as \"Kermak Fermi\" at ceremonies.\n    \n    During clan events, such as reunions or head-of-clan elections, the last name is used in place of clan names when referring to a person.  IE: Kermak son of Anori.  This is to prevent confusion among clan members as almost everyone in attendance is from the same clan.  Galleans may change their clan names through marriage.  If a married couple chooses not to have a shared clan name, their offspring will keep the clan name of their parent of the same gender. \n\n    The gallean naming structure was standardized after the [!2 Gallean World War] in the year -40.  Before the war, multiple, various naming structures existed which, which had led to clashing international paperwork.

While it does provide basic encryption and protection from threats, the company has a notable subsidiary -- Nexus Server Security -- which sells higher-level encryption and protection services for clients. \n\n    Due to the naturally freezing temperatures of [!1 Gallea], as well as the vast tech industry presence on the planet, Gallea was the perfect place to base vast Server farms with little cost put into the cooling infrastructure.  Many server farms pull in cold air or radiate heat directly into the cold ice of the surface, leading to a reduced cost of cooling, which means a lower price charged to the end consumer.  It’s direct connection to other GCP worlds by [!3 Quantum node] infrastructure means that it has fewer interruptions over interplanetary connections than other competing services.\u0000css\n    Founded in the year 56 as a joint private and public venture, Nexus Hosting has always had an uncommon advantage over most other hosting companies due to lowered cooling cost.  Nexus Hosting’s founding came as a government mandate, seeing the new internet begin to rapidly spread in the GCP, the government felt it needed to be on the forefront of the new technology and communications wave, and secure a place of strength.  With it’s direct use of government infrastructure at no cost and start-up capital provided directly from the government, it was able to rapidly buy out other small hosting firms that were just starting up.  Nexus Hosting has a near total monopoly on Gallea and Gallean colonies while commending a significant market share of hosting for foreign governments and corporations across the GCP. \n\n    It is not hidden that the Gallean Government exclusively uses Nexus Hosting for data services, and even runs its most sensitive files through its servers.  The Gallean military uses Nexus Hosting servers through its command ships and relay stations. \n\n    Due to the company being partly state-owned, 35% of shares are permanently owned by the Gallean State Government and 50% of all profit the company makes goes directly towards state funds.

        "data": "css\n    Predecessor to the current [!1 Gallean Social Uplift Program], the Gallean Reconstruction Program (referred to as \"GRP\") was initiated the year after the conclusion of the [!2 Gallean World War] by the fledgling Gallean Republic.  It would last until the year -20 when it would be reinstated as the Gallean Social Uplift Program. \n\n    In the wake of the [!2 Gallean World War], the planet was devastated, few areas of the surface weren’t scarred by artillery or carpet bombs.  A few small enclaves of industry remained, notably one near the current Capital, [!3 Heralius], and it was from these places that [!4 Gallea] would begin its reconstruction.  With the new world government beginning to properly stabilize itself, the military budgets that once exceeded 30% of an individual nation’s GDP on average, dropped to 2% for the new government.  All that cashflow would now fall under the GRP’s budget. \n\n    For the first two years, the program rebuilt factories in the enclaves of industry that were damaged by the war, and began expanding on those that were still standing, done in order to expand the domestic industrial capacity.  Contrary to some of the fears, perpetuated by the losing side of the war, the new government did not nationalize most of the industry, but did subsidize companies that improved efficiency and provided quality work during the run of the program.\u0000css\n    After the first two years, the project's focus was shifted towards the infrastructure of essentials: roads, water, food, power, and temporary housing.  This phase would last until the reinstatement of the program in -20 P.W..  Local businesses and corporations were given contracts for road construction, with their work being overseen by meticulous GRP inspectors.  One of the few beneficial outcomes of the war was that many sectors had a \"clean slate\", allowing for more efficient infrastructure as opposed to relying on the outdated/obsolete infrastructure that had been destroyed through the war.  The Energy Industry was the only industry to get truly nationalized, though only partly; the distribution of energy was controlled by the state, however privately-owned power plants could exist and get paid by the state based on the amount of energy demand they could satisfy. \n    Railroads were constructed with a similar mix of private and public cooperation, where businesses would aquire government contracts to build the railroads with GRP oversight; train companies were subsidized to expand their routes onto new lines. \n\n    As a result of all these new companies getting government funding (meant to keep expanding and rebuilding with efficiency in mind), many new jobs for those left unemployed and hungry by the war opened up to support the new projects.  These new jobs allowed workers to afford some luxuries and consumer goods, stimulating local and regional economies.\u0000css\n    A core component of the GRP was the quick construction of small, temporary homes for those who lost their shelter and livelihoods from the war.  They were built in complexes known as Warm Homes, constructed around a central building where the complex administration would find residents work, or in many cases would provide new, state-run education to previously-poorly-educated Galleats.  Many of these complexes have been demolished for newer buildings but a few still exist and have been designated National Heritage Sites which can be visited even today.  The homes themselves were not much better than those in the average slum, but they were cheap, and all of the essentials were provided at a fraction of the cost of a typical pre-war apartment.\n\n    The doctrine for the investments was, at first, to connect all the major cities to the industrial enclaves.  From there, infrastructure was built back to pre-war levels.  After inner city roads and power were restored, rails and roads were extended like webs over [!4 Gallea’s] surface and under it’s ice.  The road and rail lines had electrical infrastructure built into them, giving previously-dark rural agricultural areas electricity.  This allowed for extended expansion and mechinization of agrigulture.  As the basic infrastructure was finished, the Warm Homes were constructed and industry was rebuilt.  Infrastructure focus then switched from expansion to maintaining and updating what had already been built, and the freed up capital was then spent specifically targeting low development areas and systematically subsidizing and stimulating local economies.",

Customarily, most Tyventian noodle soups are spicy and slightly sweet, while the noodles themselves are chewy and toothsome, deeply-flavored from having been cooked in broth.  Tyventian noodles are popular throughout New Tyventia and Neo Urra, alongside several ethnic enclaves within other nations.\n\n    Noodles are a staple food for the majority of the [!2 Tyvant] population, especially for the working class, who find noodle soup to be easy to prepare and applicable to any palette.  This dish is usually consumed in the evening as dinner: the broth, if made from scratch, is started on in the morning, simmers throughout the day, and is ready for use in a noodle soup recipe by dusk.  The usual accompaniment for Tyventian noodle soups is a green salad, most popularly Tyventian Mint Salad.\n\n    To prepare this dish, vegetables, pieces of meat, boiled eggs, herbs, spices, sauces, et cetera, are added to a simmering broth, followed by the noodles some time after.  Once everything has cooked, the dish is ready to be served.\n\n    Historical evidence shows that noodle soup has been consumed on Kayan ever since grains were first milled into flour.  As time went by, the soup began to increase in complexity, with new seasonings and flavors being added as trade caused ingredients to be diffused across Kayan.  Now, modern Tyventian Noodle Soup has hundreds of different variants, each made to cater to a specific palette.",

The species bears a B-type body, with digitigrade legs and well-furred bodies.  Furstian fur covers most of the body lightly and quite evenly, but grows out longer and thicker on the top of the head and around the groin.  The color of this fur can range from a variety of shades, most typically brown, black, white, gray, red, and/or cream, depending on the genetic makeup of the subject.  Furstians have four clove digits per each of their two hands along with four cloves on each foot.  Trailing from their backs are long, thick tails which are used primarily for balance when standing upright and for other various activities, such as communal huddling, cuddling, and unarmed combat.  Upon their heads, Furstians also bear two long, pointy, concave, front-facing, orientable ears, alongside a pair of boney antlers.\u0000css\n    Within their mouths, Furstian males have an iconic pair of long, sharp, lengthy canine teeth (though those of a female are just a bit smaller and slightly less prominent).  The noses and jaws of a Furstian protrude a noticeable distance from the rest of the face, forming a sort of muzzle.  Furstian sclerae are brown while their triangular irises may be of a variety of colors, depending on genetics.\n\n    It is observed that Furstian leg muscles are quite well-defined and naturally well-toned, though a seamless explanation as to why is currently lacking, with the best theory claiming the need for leg strength in mountaineering.  Despite this, their top movement speed is still a bit lower than that of other bipedal species, as their legs are rather clumsy by nature; as previously stated, Furstians rely on their tails for bipedal support to some extent.  Some may cite a paradox pertaining to how Furstians supposedly have muscular frames for mountain climbing despite having slightly undexterous legs, which should theoretically discourage the traversal of rough terrain.  In reality, however, Furstians have been noted to naturally excel decently in mountaineering, in spite of their klutzy legs.\n\n    Furstians are apparently biologically hardwired to be more sociable and amiable creatures.  Due to this, Furstians tend to grow to become excellent at efficient communication, and have a reputation for being very eloquent in delivering ideas and are just as good at receiving them.\u0000css\n\n    There has been much debate in the past over whether Furstians should be considered a race of [!2 Deorian] or as its own species.  Genetically speaking, Furstians do share more than 99% of their DNA with [!3 Ricefieldic Deorians], though the physical and psychological differences cannot so easily be ignored.  It is believed that Furstians are from an offshoot of a common ancestor shared with Ricefieldic Deorians, which somehow crossed into the far-fletched regions of Polensend and isolated their communities from other Deorians for a few eons, resulting in the creation of a unique branch.  As of now, the general consensus mandates that Furstians are, indeed, their own species, but are to be referred to as “Furstian Deorians” for semantic and political reasons.\n\n    Despite this, Furstian Deorians can crossbreed with other Deorians and create offspring, called \"Zgorians\".  However, Zgorians are infertile due to Furstians and Deorians having different numbers of chromosomes.  Their expected lifespan is also reduced by about 3 years.\n\n    An interesting fact to note: caffeine (a stimulant/pesticide present primarily in a particular family of roots originating from [!4 Itascus]) has aphrodisiac-like and intoxicating effects on the Furstian species, effects somewhat similar to those caused by [!5 Ceiraz] \"aphroteasiac\", but significantly amplified to the point of even causing dangerous and/or risky behavior.  If too much is ingested, the individual will begin to experience a euphoric high accompanied by mild delusions and the exhibition of extraordinarily inappropriate behaviors.  If a critical amount is metabolized, the subject may go into cardiac arrest and die.  Due to this, the production, sale, and consumption of any food or drink containing a non-negligible amount of caffeine among Furstians is well-regulated.",

        "data": "css\n    The Gallean Social Uplift Program, or GSUP, is a strategic social welfare program operated by the [!1 Gallean government].  Its priority is the rapid development of under-developed regions on the planet of [!2 Gallea].  It took on the responsibilities of the [!3 Gallean Reconstruction Program] in the year -20 P.W. when it was reinstated and reformed into the GSUP.  The goal of the program is to create a globally balanced but regionally specialized economic situation on Gallea. \n\n    Every 2 [!2 Gallean years], the GSUP compiles a list of the most underdeveloped, poverty-stricken, unemployed, and unhealthy cities, towns, or even regions; this list is known as the Necessary Uplift Priority (NUP).  The GSUP then does a long process of calculating the costs of uplifting those locations.  After expenses have been calculated and plans drawn, the most severe areas on the NUP will get the necessary funding allocated and uplift will be initiated; this is done in a process of greenlighting the uplift of the most severe region, then greenlighting the next most severe until the necessary funds for the next most severely needed uplift on the NUP is too much for the project's funds.  The leftover funds that were deemed too little to fund a new uplift would be allocated as needed to the current uplifts.\n\n    Uplifting, as defined by the GSUP charter, is the socio-economic improvement of a poor region/location to where the average per capita wealth is above $20,000 [!4 ITC] a year.  Uplifting occurs in phases: the 1st phase is infrastructure, the 2nd is public transport, the 3rd is strategic stimulus. \n\n    In the 1st phase, infrastructure for transport, water, electricity, gas, etc., is repaired, then expanded within the region.  Thanks to the successes of the GRP, this phase is normally very complete and is still a part of the GSUP to ensure that nothing is missed.\u0000css\n    In the 2nd phase, comprehensive networks of public transport, from buses to monorails to even subways are planned and developed.  Local, interregional, and global routes are then connected with the transport system.  The entirety of the system is free for Galleans to use and has been shown to improve the ability for Galleans to commute while reducing costs.  After GSUP has created these transport options, the responsibility of maintaining and operating them is transferred to the [!5 Gallean Transit Authority], with whom they will be upkept and expanded with time. \n\n    In the 3rd phase, strategic stimulus, local companies and corporations alike receive incentives to set up shop in the region being focused on, or to expand their pre-existing operations.  The exact industries focused on depend on the region itself: some regions may have a strong tradition of film, for example, and as such the GSUP will focus on the local film industry.  If, instead, the area is perhaps rich in minerals, mining companies get the priority.  The intention is not to create balanced local economies, but specialized ones, each depending on another regional economy to create a sense of unity throughout the planet. \n\n    Not every uplift will follow these phases exactly, and most differ in at least one way, depending on the individual needs of a region or township.",

During the 50’s, [!3 Itascan] xeno-cuisine researchers arrived on [!1 Kayan] to study and record the culinary cultures present on the planet.  Returning to [!4 Itascus], they brought back the ancient recipe, and it was shared amongst various cooks, corporations, and food scientists around the globe.  Despite the prominence of seafood on Itascus, however, the classic snails and other Tyventian seafood options were not very palatable to most, and the process of de-snailing the shells was rather foreign to many younger Itascans, especially to those who lived far inland or in mountainous regions.  Thus, the snails were commonly replaced in Itascan culinary settings; one of the most common replacements for the snails other than native mollusks is Itascan meatballs with [!5 Tyventian] seasoning, and the dish is almost always accompanied with fries at most restaurants.\u0000css\n    Tyventian meatball noodle soup, alongside the other Itascanized variations of the traditional dish, is a landmark of Itascan-Tyentian cultural exchanges.  Many Itascan-Tyventian enclaves on Itascus use the dish as an icon of their dual-heritage.\n\n    While the dish is consumed by all social classes, its canned form (minus the fries, which cannot be effectively canned with the soup) was made to appeal to the working class, serving as a quick and easy-to-prepare meal for those who have little time to prepare the soup the traditional way, or for those who lack the money to purchase all the ingredients necessary to make the dish in its entirety.  The soup is also typically seen being sold by Tyventian street food vendors in Tyventian enclaves.\n\n    Native Tyventians have relatively mixed opinions on the meatball variation of their cultural dish: some enjoy the strong, rich taste of the Itascan-style meatballs and the addition of fries to the plating, while others see it as a bastardization of their beloved culinary traditions. \n\n    When preparing the meatball variation of Tyventian noodle soup, small meatballs (which may be made of any kind of meat, most popularly fish, shellfish, or livestock) are added to the broth as it simmers instead of snails or chunks of shellfish being added nearing the end of the cooking time.  The meatballs add a stronger meaty flavor to the broth and the noodles.  As previously mentioned, fries are also usually served with the noodles, commonly seen simply being piled on top of the bowl.  Many are fond of soaking the fries in the soup, which makes the fries taste a little sweet and spicy.",

The trunk of the Pageenda Pepay tree is notably barren of any leaves or plumage, with a strange “platform” of branches forming just underneath the fruit.  It has a dozen simple mucronate leaves on its top, originating from the centre of the trunk; this is believed to have the purpose of being exposed to as much sunlight as possible and to channel water to its base.  The Pageenda fruit is large, heavy, and yellow, and when cracked open, has an orange-ish flesh with dozens of small, marble-sized seeds spread out across the entire plant.  The plant’s outer skin has two distinct phases: a soft and hard phase.  The hard phase spans from the germination to maturity of the fruit, after which the skin softens and becomes easier to crack or puncture.  The fruit is noticeably tasteless; however, its smell has been defined as very fragrant, and thus has been utilized by Itascan soapmakers for centuries.  The fruit itself weighs 2.5 to 3.5 kg.\u0000css\n    The history of the Pageenda Pepay dates back to prehistoric times, before the evolution of the modern [!2 Itascan species] as we know it.  During that time, the Pageenda family contained hundreds of different Pageenda species.  However, an unknown bottleneck in about -100,000,000 P.W. caused nearly all of them to go extinct, with the exception of two species.  One is the Pageenda Pepay, and the other is the Pageenda Magna.  Many of the defining features of the Pageenda Pepay originated from this bottleneck, wherein the need to specialize to a specific niche became necessary for the continued survival of the species.  It is believed that an endangered third Pageenda species existed until 17 P.W. but died out due to the environmental effects of the [!3 Itascan World War]; it is unknown if this is true, however, or if it was simply a different misclassified plant species that had not been previously discovered.",

Keen not to repeat their disaster at the hands of Union of Communal Mineworkers members at the [!3 Battle of the Salted Gates], the Urrans rushed in anti-riot infantry and light vehicles from several garrisons when the miners of the town of Grevaore downed tools and pledged their allegiance to the UCM.  The UCM also deployed thousands of its own members to the area in support of the strikers, thus setting up another violent confrontation between the two sides.\u0000css\n    During the battle, the UCM deployed their typical style of primitive mass assaults against Urran lines, using improvised weapons and throwing whatever they could get their hands on.  However, these tactics proved less effective than the UCM had expected them to be at Grevaore, because this time, they did not outnumber their opponents to the point where they could be overwhelmed.  Periodically, the Urrans opened up their lines for Uttan vehicles to rush through and fire on strikers using either lethal or non-lethal ammunition, although vehicles were forced to retreat back behind Urran lines quickly, lest they were disabled or overrun.  These two factors quickly gave the Urrans the upper hand, and subsequently led to victory around 10 hours after the UCM’s first charge.  Many UCM strikers retreated completely, while a few dozen locals made a fatal last stand in the town.  During the night following the battle, all the residents of Grevaore the Urrans could locate were arrested and hundreds of security personnel occupied the town to guarantee the loyalty of replacement miners.\n\n    This battle was one of the more significant conflicts of the union strikes, as this was the first major defeat for the UCM.  The severe reprisals arguably prevented as many communities from joining the UCM, who otherwise would have supported them.  Indeed, the rate of communities joining the movement slowed down after the battle, although this certainly did not mark the end of bloody confrontations between the UCM and Urran forces.",

Arkua Banken roughly translates to \"Lunar Storm Rifle\", which is its name in [!1 Unil]. Its slow-but-steady 700-rpm fire rate, alongside its 25 round aluminum magazine, has proven capable of providing precise suppressive fire to the Armalite military.  The weapon is chambered in the intermediate 5.56x41mm ACR cartdridge, with decent stopping power at up to 500 meters.  After the [!2 Battle of Armalai], it had become popular among soldiers and civilians, being then adopted as a Standard Issue rifle, which is still in use to this day.  The weapon's frame is mainly composed of high-grade military polymer, with the internal mechanisms made out of titanium, giving the weapon a low failure and breakdown rate.  On the top of the weapon, between the ironsights, is a medium rail for attachments.  The gun costs around $1,000 to produce, and can be picked up on the civilian aftermarket for ~$1,200.\u0000css\n    Thanks to the great success of the NBK in 82 p.w, the rifle's inventor, Railu Miku, managed to gather the needed funds for the creation of a new, more complex weapon.  After 4 years of research and development, the first prototypes of the AKBK were finished, and quickly made available for purchase by [!3 GCP] militaries.  In the year 86, the Arkua Banken's first prototype was released, showing new techniques of manufacturing and materials, the AKB caught the eye of the [!4 Armalite] military as an alternative to the existing rifles.  However, it wasn't until the [!1 Battle of Armalai], in the year of 102, and after many modifications, that the rifle showed its showed its potential firepower.",

        "data": "css\n    Salvatorism is the most dominant religion on [!1 Itascus], and bears numerous denominations and sects with which many Itascans and non-Itascans alike identify.  The religion is thought to have been practiced ever since the beginning of civilization on Itascus itself, thus making it the oldest of Itascan belief systems.  Evidence suggests that the religion began in what is now the [!1 Kullmi Province], with a multitude of ancient manuscripts describing a religion very similar to modern Salvatorism.  Salvatorism spread to Ferika during Itascus' Late Antiquity through the development of long-distance trade routes and more advanced transportation technologies.  It became very popular within Ferika and eventually outgrew the pre-existing Ferikan religions, becoming the dominant belief system in both Kullmia and Ferika.\n\n    Salvatorism is monotheistic, and all denominations universally agree on the existence of a single omnipotent deity who was responsible for the creation of the universe, though each denomination has its own understanding of what this god is like and how they must be honored and served.  This god is named \"Jheiyah\", but the diety is almost exclusively referred to as simply \"God\" or \"The Lord\".  Most denominations share the concept that this god is benevolent by nature, as is thus worthy of great praise and worship as a means of showing gratitude for the gift of existence.  The Salvatorist deity is worshipped by the majority of denominations through prayers, songs, participation in diet-related events, and occasionally sacrifice, though the latter two worship methods are less common across the denominations compared to the former.\u0000css\n    Salvatorists believe that their deity's sacred teachings and commands had been transcribed and compiled by mankind over many years in the distant past in the form of what is now known as the Great Gospel -- the final, definitive form of God's Word.  Salvatorists devote themselves to following the teachings written in this book as accurately as they can, believing that having faith in their god and following their god's teachings well would allow one access to the heaven post-mortem.  The concept of the afterlife to most salvatorists involves two extremes: Heaven, a beautiful utopia where loyal disciples are permitted to bask in the direct glory of their god for eternity; and Hell, a horrifying place devoid of anything one might consider \"good\" reserved for those who reject the deity's guidance; Salvatorist hell is usually depicted as a realm consisting only of a murky ocean with either no land or no surface entirely, and it is heavily implied that a part of hell's punishment is the inability to see or breathe.  Salvatorists believe that all humans are flawed and hellbound by default, and that following their deity's commands and teachings is necessary to even have a chance at earning a place in heaven.\n\n    Salvatorists tend to conduct their worship in groups (as per tradition), and usually meet together at temples at the end of every [!2 Itascan week], as per the command of scripture.  Worship services usually consist of a preaching session, then a pious song and dance session, then a prayer session, before finally adjourning; some denominations also include a sacrifice session before prayer.  Authoritative figures, known as priests, orate the preaching sections, and in denominations where animal sacrifice is practiced, it is also the priest's job to kill and offer up the sacrifice to the deity.\u0000css\n    One very important figure in the Salvatorist religion was a fisherman named Innovis, who lived during Itascus' Classical Era, around 700 years before the invention of [!3 Warp Drive].  Innovis was a prophet who claimed to have been the Lord, Jheiyah, in human form.  This bold claim gave way to a huge turning point in the religion's continuity.  For context, it had been previously prophesied that such an event would happen: that their god would one day walk the world as a man amongst mankind to serve as a symbol of their salvation.  Many believed that Innovis was this man,  especially due to the various supernatural acts he had allegedly committed throughout his ministry, and they celebrated the arrival of their savior.  Others argued that Innovis was a fraud and set out to prove his blasphemy.  As it is written, just after Innovis had reached his peak popularity, he was killed via several stab wounds from fishing spears by a group of assassins consisting of some members of a regional mercenary group, who had been hired by Innovis’ opposition.  The controversies of Innovis' life and death established a great divide in the various Salvatorist doctrines which still exists to this day, as theologists continue to argue whether or not Innovis really was the Jheiyah, and if the lord had truly been struck down by mortal hand.\u0000css\n    Broadly summarizing the most important and universally-accepted teachings and commandments of Salvatorism, the religion teaches the following basic commandments: one must accept and actively acknowledge the existence of the Salvatorist god, one must habitually praise and worship the god, one must not blaspheme, and that one must not resist the various other teachings and commands listed in the Great Gospel.  Different denominations have different ways of interpreting these basic principles, and some may include caveats or extra rules, such as adding animal sacrifice as a necessary practice or requiring the worship of various prophets alongside Jheiyah, most commonly Innovis, who is seen by the majority of denominations as an entity both separate and somehow the same as their god.\u0000css\n    The creation story of the universe defined by the Great Gospel states that there is a god who is not bound by time, space, nor dimension who spoke the universe into existence and formed the world ([!1 Itascus]) with the power of his command, materializing mud and rock for the ground, making a fire for the sun, and vast stone for the mountain ranges.  As he worked, the sweat of their labor to form the vast oceans of Itascus, a testament to the great care they put into creating a world for his flock to inhabit.  It is said that Jheiyah, after having created the universe and the [!4 Sol system], then decided to bring animacy to the mix by attempting to draft various creatures in hopes of creating the perfect host for intelligence, failing numerous times and creating a plethora of species before finally settling on the Itascan human species -- some clashes between the denominations can be found here.  According to the Great Gospel, the deity made life solely for Itascus, as it was God's special planet, and left the stars of the galaxy barren, only meant to be viewed as decorations in the night sky.  When the Itascans first encountered extraterrestrial sapients, the Salvatorists were shocked, and discussion arose to settle what this meant.  Many Salvatorists claimed that, perhaps, their god had simply kept alien life a secret for some specific purpose; the majority believes that aliens are simply early, imperfect drafts of [!5 Itascan humans], experiments made by God to perfect their fleshwork.  Some believe that, to to Jheiyah, these other species of human are equal in importance to Itascan humans, while others take on a more xenophobic stance, asserting that alien life consists of cosmic mistakes, akin to animals which God chose to hide from Itascan eyes.",

Talhov Brains are most often used for autonomous movement of robotic systems, visual and audio recognition, and general-purpose human-oriented intelligence.  A Talhov Brain is the most plastic and general-purpose artificial intelligence known to the [!2 GCP], but conversely, it is also incredibly spontanous and unreliable.  While Talhov Brains are commonly used for human-like intelligences, they typically underperform biological humans in social settings, and are seen as unintelligent.  However, the speed at which Talhov Brains solve problems (whether the solution is correct or not) is typically considerably faster than that of most humans.  Socially-oriented Talhov Brains are known to have simple emotions, identical to most human emotions and moods (due to the AIs having been trained on real-world people).\n    \n    Talhov Brains are most commonly used for small autonomous robots, personal companions, and chatbots.  However, they are rarely used for automating devices or systems, especially not heavy machinery with little margin for error -- Talhov Brains, being built on the Talhov Framework, are notably spontanous and curious, meaning they will experiment and \"play\" with any hardware they are at the helm of, which can be very risky if the AI is placed in a position of responsibility or operation of dangerous hardware, such as industrial machinery, weaponry, or motor vehicles and spacecraft.\u0000css\n    This system was developed in the year 92 by a [!3 Tuine] scientist named Chesk Talhov, a computer hardware engineer with paranoid schizophrenia.  Chesk had set out using random number generation and artificial intelligence in an attempt to talk directly to God.  In order to collect the massive amount of data on spoken language he needed, he created the website [!4 BT.CHATTERBOX], which was a website where people could connect and \"Talk to an AI\" over voice or text.  The website became very popular across the galactic internet, gaining hundreds of thousands of unique visitors.  The site remained up for a period of one [!5 galactic year], over which the AI became noticably more humanlike in is conversational abilities and speech recognition (though still distinctly unhuman).  During this time, Chesk was still refining the Talhov Framework, off of which all Talhov Brains are built.  He also released many small, online games, also made to gather data to train AI.  After this period, the Chatter service went offline, with the front page of the website only showing a note thanking all of the site's users for their continued support.\u0000css\n    After Chatterbox went offline, Chesk Talhov had all the data he needed, and created a Nodule for his framework that talked and thought like a low-intelligence human.  Talhov released this framework, and the nodule, for free online, and it was quickly adopted by many programmers and hacker groups.  Within weeks, hundreds of thousands of instances of Talhov Brains were being used by hundreds of unconnected hacker groups to commit cyber crimes.  The majority of these crimes were in the form of automated scams, costing an estimated total of $1,400,000,000 in losses in the year 93.  Due to the unprecidented nature and scale of the scams, state governments assumed it was done by a previously-unknown organized crime syndicate.  The scam software was traced back to Chesk Talhov, and he was arrested by [!3 Tuine] state police within 10 days of posting the Talhov Framework.  He was cleared of his suspicion of committing the above crimes, but he remained in custody of the state, where he still is to this day.  Many suspect that he is currently secretively working for the Tuine state government.  However, this theory unconfirmed and unsubstantiated.",

The Talhov Framework achieves its self-learning capabilities through constantly reprogramming itself in a manner similar to how organic neuron bundles in biological brains do.  Due to the manner of their creation, Talhov Framework AIs have \"emotions\" or \"moods\", which assist with decision making.

Each image contains every memory, tendency, and skill of a Talhov Brain.\u0000css\n    The framework is made to be modular, allowing for the integration of pre-made modules called \"Nodules\".  Nodules allow for support for things like human language conversation, understandings of physics, image recognition, and so on.  In order for a nodule to be added to a Talhov Framework, it must be \"Integrated\", which is a complicated process that requires a lot of time and/or processing power, in which the neurons of the system are randomly cut, reconnected, and checked until they are bruteforced into a connection with the neurons of the nodule.  Due to the random nature of integration, the process is destructive -- integration often has unintended effects on unrelated logic in the framework.  To get around this, most distributors make thousands of images of the framework before integration and performing integration on each.  After integrating each image individually, the image that exhibits the fewest unintended issues is chosen and distributed.",

In general, a typical, traditional pie from [!1 Ceiraz] will consist of a pie crust filled with a mixture of smoked [!2 Isfe] meat, gravy made from the rabbit`s drippings, and wild berries, well-seasoned and covered with another decorative layer of pie dough.  The dish is sweet and savory, and is notably rich and even somewhat creamy, thanks to the inclusion of the aforementioned gravy in the filling.  The crust, being made from a combination of [!3 Deorian wheat] flour, Isfe lard, and hot water, is normally a little dense and greasy, but still adequately flaky.  Deorian meat pies are popular all over the [!4 Silver Stream] in the modern era, most notably within [!1 Deorian] space and in [!5 Ghillymede].\u0000css\n    To our current understanding, the meat pies, as described, were historically reserved for important individuals such as leaders, priests, nobles, and foreign envoys, and were usually only eaten on special occasions, such as during the [!6 Ceiraz Lunar Festival] or birthdays of important individuals.  Commoners would have instead consumed a simpler dish of just the meat and berries, stewed together with coarse grains to form a rustic stew.  In the modern era, individuals from all stratums may be found consuming Deorian meat pies, with or without an occasion.  Deorian meat pies have become so greatly associated with [!7 Deorian culture] and culinary tradition that bakers must follow specific guidelines when making these pies in order to market them as “Deorian meat pie”, and even more rules and procedures in order to sell them as “[!8 Pacemist]-certified”.\n\n    To prepare a traditional Ceiraz meat pie, one must first prepare a crust out of Deorian wheat flour, [!2 Isfe] lard, and hot water and set it aside.  A filling is then to be made out of a smoked Isfe, shredded into bits and mixed with Isfe gravy and a variety of wild berries which are to be dumped into the crust.  Another layer of crust is placed on top, which is, as previously mentioned, usually decorative.  Once the pie is assembled, it is cast into an oven until the crust begins to brown.  The pie is then drenched with a sweet-and-savory berry sauce and allowed to cool slightly before it is served in modest slices.\u0000css\n    Deorian meat pies have been made since Deoria’s ancient times, although they were then considered to be much closer to luxury festival food than a common meal.  Archeological evidence of pie-making on Deoria includes clay baking dishes and ornate clay tablets depicting certain round food items being served to ancient leaders.  The earliest written records of Deorian meat pies date back to around Deoria`s Bronze Age, where a Ceiraz priestess writes:\n    \"There is a foreign diplomatic progression standing before our city`s walls.  Among them stands their leader: a bold man who wears the antlers of his rivals and the teeth of his prey.  He has come to request a pact with our nation, as his warrior clan is in decline and requires some form of support.  As a sign of goodwill and future benevolence, we have sent them a congregation bearing artful pies of smoke-cured meat and sweet mountain berries.\"\n\n    As better agricultural technology was developed and as many Deorians began to move away from [!8 Pacemistic] values, the making of Deorian meat pies was made significantly easier and the dish began to be eaten by all social classes within a short period after Deoria`s Industrial Revolution, regardless of the occasion.  The pie would eventually diffuse into the cuisines of other nations, eventually leading to its current interstellar popularity.",

SodaPop is currently the most popular and diverse video sharing site within the GCP, and is used by millions of users daily.\n\n    SodaPop was originally created by Moonflower Forest the Red, a [!3 Ceiraz Deorian] who was a university student at the [!4 Ceiraz Academy of Engineers] at the time, in the year 90 as a project for her computer science class.  Originally, the site only permitted short videos and had exclusively one server based in her university dorm room, but it quickly gained popularity throughout her campus and was soon being used as the go-to website to check in on the business of students and staff.  Eventually, this popularity leaked outside of the campus, and within a few years, it became evident that the site needed a proper launch and better servers.  Thus, in 91 P.W., Red officially launched a more refined version of the site and set up several servers across [!5 Ricefield], additionally founding a company under the same name as the site.\u0000css\n    By 93 P.W., almost all of Deoria had access to SodaPop, and once again, its popularity began to spread further than its sphere of influence: in 94 P.W., [!6 Itascus City], [!7 Itascus] became the first non-Deorian server host for SodaPop.  Initially, SodaPop`s success on Itascus was severely hindered by the lack of professional localization on the platform.  Thus, shortly after being introduced to Itascus, the site was properly translated into [!8 Unil] and several other major Itascan languages.  In 95 P.W., SodaPop was launched on [!9 Gallea] and [!10 Armalai], followed by [!11 La`foy] soon after, naturally being translated into those nations` respective languages as well.\n\n    As of the current day, SodaPop`s services are available on most inhabited planets.  [!12 Neo Urra] is the only nation which does not host any SodaPop servers, as the site is banned by the Neo Urran government.",

It prohibits the antlers of the affected from regrowing at any point after the completion of their initial grow-in.  The disorder is not inherently threatening to one`s life or health, but may result in social confusion due to the significance of one`s rack in nonverbal communication across Deorian cultures.\n\n    The disease appears to be caused by a certain mutation in one Deorian chromosome responsible for facilitating antler growth.  Essentially, the mutation disables the body from directing the sending of the nutrients necessary for antler growth to the antlers after they first grow in, thus preventing further growth.  As a side note, researchers have noted a positive correlation between Deorian-Furstian interbreeding and their offsprings` chance of acquiring ARD; [!2 Zgorians] are at an elevated risk of being born with the mutation which causes antler regrowth dysfunction.\u0000css\n    As of now, there are currently no reliable treatment methods for this condition.  [!3 Transition Genetics] has been experimenting with ways to prevent the acquisition of the disorder for the last few decades, and had seen some success with [!4 Servuses], whose first generations were never observed to have had the culprit mutation.  However, it should be noted that over just a couple generations of Servuses, the mutation began to make a return at an exponential rate, implying that the artificial trait of guaranteed resilience against ARD is likely uninheritable or even undesirable.",

        "data": "css\nBackground & Pre-War Societal Shifts:\n    Gallean Royalty’s image sharply declined leading up to and during the [!1 Gallean World War].  While a few monarchies, principalities, and duchies governed in an enlightened and empathetic way, the majority were still ruled in a vastly absolutist manner.  The culture that had supported these hierarchies was steadily degrading; with the spread of [!2 Gearthmeiaism] among the servant and artisan classes, the 'divine right' of the rulers was diminishing. \n\n    The degrading social stability broke out into a few peaceful and violent revolutions, where multiple monarchies were overthrown and replaced by new governments following more socialist and collectivist ideals.  Ultimately, the [!1 Gallean World War] can be attributed to the surviving monarchies trying to maintain their status quo, anxious of societal upheaval destroying them, and the Revolutionary movements wishing to rid Gallea of its poisonous hierarchical past. \n\n    One part of the changing world that proved beneficial to these waning monarchies was Nationalism. Nationalism sprung up as a reactionary movement to the more Global, pan-Gallean ideals associated with the many flavors of Socialism.  While it was not inherently incompatible with [!2 Gearthmeiaism], it was in conflict with a few of its tenants.  There were a few Gearthmeist break-away sects that more attuned themselves with nationalism, but they were not as common as those which merely preferred to coexist.  Monarchies were able to weaponize nationalism to protect their rulerships, painting revolutionaries as trying to dilute and destroy their culture and history.   Nationalism would ever-further drive the divide between the monarchal and socialist ideologies, pushing any hopes of compromise into the dark.\u0000css\nPost-War:\n\n    After the war’s devastating impact, many monarchies were reduced to ashes, with numerous casualties of royalty.  Those who survived were forced to flee into hiding or be tried.  The Crown Trials in -46, are criticized in modern days for biased judges and juries, resulting in many royal bloodlines being put to death.\n\n    As the new Global government found its footing, from -46 to -40, many displaced royals were able to find metaphorical holes in the wall to hide in and form new lives.  Thanks to recent (at the time) books by descendants of these royals, it has been revealed that a secret society had formed between these survivors around -38.  The Royal Preservation Society (R.P.S.) would pool the resources and assets of the royals in hiding, providing fake documentation & identification, and even covering up incidents of royals exposing their cover.  R.P.S. was mostly outside of the Government’s notice, and only further faded into the obscurity as public opinions had shifted from toppling monarchs to a focus on issues with the current government. \n\n    While it would maintain a majority of the remaining royal population, R.P.S. would splinter over time.  One notable split off was the Rightful Rule faction in -2, their core ideology being that Royals should retake control of Gallea.  This faction achieved some success in local positions and a few attained military positions by 12.  Their less than subtle ideological ideals got them on the radar of the [!3 Gallean Bureau of Internal Threats] (\"GBIT\").  Subsequently, the Rightful Rule’s cells were crushed in simultaneous raids on the [!4 Night of the Melted Crowns].  It is speculated that a few members managed to escape and have reformed the Rightful Rule faction, but these rumors are thus far unsubstantiated.\u0000css\n     From the year 12 P.W. to the current day, most members of Royalty have stayed low as perceptions tempered and the generations moved on.  It is only recently that these bloodlines have come forward to lukewarm acceptance.  Most royals have integrated into modern Gallean society, following Gearthmeiaism and supporting the state.\n\n    The R.P.S. itself now publicly funds historic preservation initiatives to protect what still survives of royal blood.  Its membership has opened up to the general public as of 101, with those inside the society publicizing many internal documents.  The result was a historian resurgence across Gallea, and more historical focus has begun on documentation of the world pre-revolution.",

Omelets conventionally consist of beaten eggs which are seasoned and cooked flat on a greased skillet until almost cooked, after which, fillings, almost always including at least cheese, are placed upon the egg and the egg is folded over, forming the omelet; the egg should be made to remain creamy in the center of the omelet and soft on the exterior.  The dish has many variations, the aforementioned merely being the most common and simple configuration of the dish.  Modern omelets are evidently descended from several egg dishes introduced by the people of [!1 Kullmia] to Ferika in Itascus’ Late Middle Ages.\u0000css\n    Eggs have been eaten on Itascus by many civilizations for several millennia, but the modern iteration of omelets has only been around for a few centuries.  The earliest written record of omelets as currently known can be found in an untitled cookbook which belonged to a cook who served the Duchy of Coxville’s royal family back in the -140s in which she describes “fried eggs like a concise journal with pages of cheese”, accompanied by a vague recipe for the aforementioned “egg-books”.Earlier records of omelets describe only prototypes of the modern dish, each usually missing some component or step of the process used today or utilizing completely different methods altogether.  One notable sister dish of the omelet is the torte, also known as the Kullmian pancake or “dol” in West Kullmian (which is actually a loanword from [!2 Unil]; the native word has been lost) which is prepared by mixing eggs with the fillings and then cooking them all together into a pancake, which is sometimes either folded over or rolled up once complete.  Tortes are commonly served with vinegar mixed with spices as a dipping sauce and are more often than not seen being served as street food throughout Kullmia and within Kullmian enclaves.\u0000css\n    In the year 87 P.W., while Oversenator Painted Forest was giving a short speech at a charity event in the town of Eastern Fields, Ricefield, [!3 Deoria], a small group of Deorian-born [!4 Itascan] nationalists emerged from the crowd and attacked the oversenator with a barrage of cold, cheese-stuffed omelets before fleeing back into the bewildered congregation.  There was one injury and one casualty reported: one event attendee stumbled and fell when a nationalist rushed past him, hitting his head on the pavement and obtaining a concussion, while another, albeit elderly, attendee thought that the president had been assassinated and suffered a cardiac arrest.  The perpetrators were quickly caught and tried for the endangerment of a government official and for being the indirect cause of the aforementioned injury and death.  The court ruled guilty on all charges except for that of manslaughter and the group was sentenced to 4 [!5 Silver Years] in prison.  As a result of the incident, many have begun to associate cheese omelets with Itascan nationalism, and the slang term “omelet-slinger” has arisen in [!2 Unil] as a term for a speciesist, especially one who is speciesist specifically against [!6 Deorians].  Additionally, the incident sparked the formation of [! The Senatorial Guard], which would assume the role of ensuring the protection of Deorian government officials and visiting foreign officials, a task which was previously only handled by local and/or state authorities.\n\n    The etymology of “omelet” was rather difficult to pin down, primarily due to the bias of various linguists.  The current most accepted origin of the word is that it came from a now-dead Kullmian language isolate, which may also possibly explain why the other languages of Kullmia lack a modern word for the dish.  Alternatively, some suggest that the word is, in fact, native to Ferika, perhaps from Old Central Ferikan, “cumarad”, meaning “eggs”.",

This article is meant to provide a basic overview of the recent evolutionary history within the last 100 million years, and will have some generalizations and summarizations that may overlook many of the minutiae.\n\n    The most distant ancestor of the modern Galleate, which still bore some resemblance, is the pack hunting/grazing omnivore, Vagari-Galleaten.  The Vagari traveled in nomadic packs.  Due to the sparse biosphere of [!1 Gallea], their diet was made up of any biomass they could find.  Their social connections were primarily familial in nature, with a Social Hierarchy based on age.  Their posture was quadrupedal, with no discernable bias between their front or back appendages.  One of their key strengths was endurance, not specializing in speed or raw strength, allowing them to trail another animal for long distances or survive from one patch of vegetation to the next.  Their protection from the freezing cold of Gallea was provided by blubber and a thick coat of fur.\u0000css\n    The subsequent important link in the chain of ancestors was Fodiendi-Galleaten.  The social structures grew complex as more than one family of Fodiendi would form herds.  With this increased population, the need for temporary burrows arose.  The front legs of the Vagari had grown larger, and the claws at the paws had become larger and more emphasized, specializing into arms.  These claws were efficient at carving burrows, especially when work was done in a team.  The claws also proved useful in hunting.  In conjunction with retaining the endurance of the Vagari, the Fodiendi were capable hunters; the extra bulk had shifted the body's center of mass forward with a more extended spine, widened shoulder area, and longer forearms.  These changes coincided with a hybrid posture; Fodiendi would balance on their hind legs while digging, but for the most part stayed quadrupedal. \n\n    The now closest ancestor species to the modern Galleate was the Tribrectus-Galleaten.  Commonly nicknamed the ‘Early Galleat’; these most strongly resemble the modern Galleates out of all previously discussed specimens.  This species had begun using tools, and their social structures were almost tribal or clan-like.  Due to their use of tools, the physical buildup of the Fodiendi in the fore section decreased in the Tribrectus but was still fairly noticeable with long arms and wider shoulders.  One very important development was the bi-pedal posture, while not as straight as a modern Galleate, the Tribrectus’ bi-pedal stance allowed its forearms and claws to evolve into nimble manipulators.  Comprised of 4 digits -- three main digits, and an opposable thumb -- the hands allowed for precision.  The claws once used extensively for digging had grown duller and less prominent, which made them more general-purpose.",

Traditionally, boadges were only prepared and consumed during certain holidays and festivals, but have also commonly been eaten for breakfast, dessert, and with coffee within many cultures on Itascus since around the year -10 P.W..  Boadges are popular across the [!2 Silver Stream], and are considered quintessential café fare.  A person who specializes in making boadges, or similar fried pastries, is referred to as a “boadger” (or “boadgeress”), and a venue that primarily produces boadges is called a “boadgery”.\n\n    Prior to Itascus’ age of global industrialization, boadges were solely eaten in celebration of certain Ferikan holidays, such as [!3 Innovillion/Gail] and [!4 Yvest], especially by those of the upper class.  When the mass-production of food and foodstuffs became widespread, and Itascan cultures further diffused across Itascus, boadges gradually started becoming increasingly common outside of celebratory contexts, though they are still consumed in far greater quantities during holidays.\u0000css\n\n    Simple boadges consist of just five ingredients: flour, eggs, sugar, butter, and a yeast leavener, which is conventionally sourdough starter, but often substituted with baker’s yeast.  The flour, eggs, sugar, and yeast are mixed together to form a dough, after which butter is slowly incorporated by flattening the dough out, spreading a layer of butter upon the dough’s surface, and folding the dough over itself, then continuously laminating the dough until multiple layers of butter have been formed.  The dough is allowed to rest and rise before it is divided into the cook’s preferred shapes and fried in hot cooking oil or lard until golden brown and cooked through.  Once cooked, they are often finished with a layer of glaze or sugar.  The end result is a soft, very sweet fritter with distinct layers as a result of the butter on the inside.\n\n    The earliest references to boadges date back to just before Itascus’ era of widespread industrialization, and are referred to as “butter fritters” or “sugar fritters” in many documents.  The term “boadge” arose much later and is of a somewhat enigmatic origin.  Some Unil linguists suggest that it is a comical contraction between the words “boat” and “barge”, alluding to how the fritters float in the cooking grease.  Others argue that it is a corruption of the word “bulge”, citing the East Ferikan street cant’s pronunciation of the word.  Notwithstanding, the modern formal spelling of the word was likely influenced by the spellings of words like “boat” and “road”.",

Digiglade provides tools for its users to create and market games and experiences built on the \"Digiglade Experience Engine\", also called the 'DEE'.  The name \"Digiglade\" is a contraction of \"Digital Glade\".\n    While being oriented towards VR Users, Digiglade also allows non-VR users, referred to as \"desktop\" users, to access its services, though to a much more limited degree, with the experience being similar to traditional first-person computer games.  However, due to their fundamentally-different and comparatively-limited medium of interaction with digital environments, Desktop Users are often stigmatized, and even forbidden from some (typically more competitive) experiences.  Despite not being the target audience, Desktop Users make up the majority of Digiglade`s userbase.\n\n    Digiglade makes use of its own virtual fiat currency called \"DigiBucks\".  DigiBucks foster a dynamic online market among Digiglade users, with the company mediating and taxing exchanges of digital goods and services. Digiglade also allows users to directly transfer Digibucks between eachother for a small fee.  DigiBucks were introduced in 102 to allow the company to monetize the platform, which directly led to a share value increase of 368% the following year.\u0000css\n    DigiBucks can be purchased from Digiglade at a rate of 10 DigiBucks per $1 [!4 ITC].  After 107, Digiglade began allowing users to sell DigiBucks back to the company at a rate of $1 per 50 Digibucks (with a minimum quantity of 50,000 digibucks), giving them a definite real-world value.  As well as for having a steep exchange rate favoring Digiglade, the company has recently come under criticism from many news outlets, and even some planetary governments, as it came apparent that DigiBucks were being used in some illegal, or otherwise unethical, interjurisdictional exchanges.  In response, the company stated they would internally monitor for suspicious exchanges in their own systems to mitigate misuse of the digital currency.  As to if they have effectively reduced cybercrime involving Digibucks is yet to be seen.\n    \n    The company was initially founded in 103, being a desktop game platform based on users creating original games using the Digiglade Experience Engine.  The company saw some small success, with its userbase being local to Itascus.  In 104, Digiglade formed a partnership with the NetGate Hardware company, in which Digiglade made its platform accessible to the NetGate-manufactured Ingress VR Headset, and advertise the hardware on their website.  In exchange, Digiglade was given a portion of all headset sales for the duration of the agreement.  The partnership was a success, with a steep increase in both Ingress Headset sales and Digiglade Experience Engine downloads.  This partnership is ofted single-handedly credited with kicking-off [!3 the second wave of VR Enthusiasm], finally bringing recreational VR into popular culture.\u0000css\n    Shortly after the NetGate deal, Digiglade as a company pivoted to be VR-oriented, officially renaming itself to \"Digiglade VR\", and making further partnerships with NetGate, as well as various other, smaller hardware companies.  In 107, Digiglade purchased NetGate as a subsidiary, and now sells the Ingress VR Headset at a loss.  With each purchase of an Ingress headset, the customer recieves a voucher for 500 Digibucks, and a data volume containing an installer for the Digiglade Experience Engine.  While each headset sale loses money for the company, it's believed Digiglade is able to still turn a profit through DigiBucks sales from those who had bought a headset unit and subsequently installed Digiglade.\n\n    Digiglade's content-base is extensive; in 107, Digiglade VR revealed in their devblog that around 70 million unique Digiglade Experience Engine Simulations (called simply \"Experiences\" on the platform) had been uploaded to their servers by their users.  This number is thought to have quadrupled in the time since it was quoted.  Many experiences are very popular, with some experiences having been known to have up to 500,000 peak concurrent players.  Some popular experiences have their own communities and cultures, with many being culturally influential enough to be known of outside of the Digiglade platform.  Creation of experiences has been shown to be very profitable; the Digiglade developer environment has been known to foster many a small professional game studio (most of which being centered around purely-Digiglade-based game development).  In fact, Digiglade offers partnership programs for developers and development firms, which can offer special promotions and monetary bonuses for the experiences they build within Digiglade.  Some of the top 100 games companies in the [!2 Silver Stream] have made partnerships with Digiglade VR to bring multi-million dollar intellectual properties to the platform in the form of experiences.",

However, the first generation of VR hardware was error-ridden and prohbitively expensive, and was eventually dismissed as an expensive fad after the turn of the century.

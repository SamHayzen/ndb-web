statement”.  For the time, this weapon was considered a marvel of engineering by the Itascans.  They were able to create modifications to the gas-compressed recoil system invented by the Tuines.  It came into common use by select military units during the [!3 Itascan World War], and soon was opened to the consumer market.  This pistol has become a symbol of Itascus, as each president since Kyle Stanley has carried one with a golden chassis, and has thus earned the rather comical nickname “Itascan Peacemaker”. Today, the gun is still used by many planets, primarily in [!4 Itascus].  While the gas-compressed recoil system is harder to maintain, many people favor this weapon for its superior stopping power as a pistol.",

It works by halting the user's menstrual cycle, rendering conception impossible in all currently-known human species, and most known animal species as well.  Ferilin dissolves very easily in water, making fluids an effective medium of application.\n\n    In ancient times, Ferilin was derived from certain plants on [!1 La'Foy] which were thought to be [!2 magical] in the nature of their effects.  While, in reality, the useful effects of the plants were actually achieved through chemical means.  In the late 20s, Ferilin was discovered to be derivable from simple chemical processes, making it producible on the large scale.  This ease of production is credited as the reason why Ferilin is cheap enough (to produce) that it was able to be deployed large-scale on [!3 Armalai].\u0000css\n    Ferilin can be potentially problematic when consumed in large quantities.  When overdosing on Ferilin, a user's physical body will cease to grow.  This does not mean that the user will \"stay young forever\", or much less become immortal; the user will still age and expire naturally.  An overdose simply means that the user will cease to develop, stunting their growth.  Save for drowning in it, there is currently no known way to fatally overdose on Ferilin.",

Primarily, it is used in [!1 Packer Shots] as a numbing agent/painkiller for patching wounds.  Theracaine also comes in cream form for non-wound topical applications, and in pills so it can act as a general painkiller.  In higher doses, Theracaine will act as a whole-body sedative.  Theracaine, across all [!2 GCP] nations, is either perscription only, emergencies only, or an outright illegal substance.\n\n    Theracaine is a common compound found in plants of every known [!3 vivotype], and therefore is a very common, and popular, endorphiat/depressant substance.  Like most endorphiats, Theracaine can be quickly removed from a user's system by dosing them with a medicine containing [!4 Terinol].  Terinol can be used to keep a user from dying from an overdose.\u0000css\n    In the case of a nonfatal overdose, a user may feel dizzy and/or overly-tired, exhibit slow speech with shallow breathing, and have an unstable gait.  If the user is of a species that has visible pupils (pupils visually discernable from the user's corneas), they will likely be made to appear very small as the corneas relax.  If someone recieves a fatal overdose of Theracaine, they will stop standing and may even fall unconscious.  At this point, the user will become unresponsive.  After this, the user's breaths will become progressively more shallow until breathing stops entirely.  The recipient of the fatal dose will expire from suffocation within minutes after they have succumb to respiratory depression.",

They were invented by a [!1 Tuine] military contractor in the year 32 as a tool to immediatly stop bleeding from combat-related wounds.  Packer Shots contain a moderate dose of [!2 Theracaine] to numb the typically-extreme pain of wounds gained through combat.  Specifically, Packer Shots are used to temporarily close bullet wounds.\u0000css\n    A standard packer shot consists of a seven-centimeter-long, one-centimeter-wide metal or hard plastic cylinder.  On the side of the cylinder is a tall button along the edge.  Inside the cylinder is a pellet of condensed fibers connected to a spring-loaded piston.  When the button is pressed, the spring is released, ejecting the fiber pellet into whatever is immediately in front of the opening on the cylinder.  Within the pellet is two chemicals: The first is a 150mg dose of Theracaine to numb the wound, and the second is reactive foam chemical.  This foam chemical, when making contact with a water-containing substance (such as blood), quickly expands and hardens.  The use of this foam is intended to immediately stop bleeding.  The pellet itself, when not expanded, is a cylinder which is almost one centimeter in diameter and three centimeters in height.  The pellet is specifically compacted to expand in the plane perpendicular to the axis through which it was inserted.  Packer shots come with a small elastic cap over the opening to keep the active chemicals from coming into contact with water when not in use.  This cap is meant to be removed before the packer pellet is applied.\n    \n    A Packer Shot is only a temporary solution to an injury.  If the wound was caused by a [!3 Ballistic weapon], a packer shot will not remove the bullet, it will simply be layered over it.  Wounds should not be allowed to heal around a Packer Shot Pellet, as this would create a permanent opening in the flesh.  After application, the recipient of a packer shot should see a physician at their earliest convenience to have the bullet removed and the wound dressed.",

Terox's active ingredient is 480mg of [!2 Terinol] (120mg per dose), which is what clears up the recipient's system.\n    \n    A unit of Terox is a small vial only 1.5 centimeters wide and 4 centimeters tall.  At the top of the vial is a spray nozzle facing upwards.  The opposite end is a rubber plunger-button that, when pressed, forces one dose of Terinol to spray out from the nozel.  The vial itself only contains four doses.\n    \n    A Terox spritzer has a remarkable ability to immediately revive someone from an endorphiate overdose, or even just halt the effects of a safe dose of endorphiats.",

A Qi entity only exists as long as the charged Qi particles within it remain contained and remain charged. \n    \n    Qi Entites have a homogenity property, meaning that all charged Qi particles within have the same spin, allignment, and \"Qi heat\".  The \"Qi heat\" describes the speed at which the entity's Qi particles move within the entity.  All three of these properties determine the entity's \"function\".  The entity's function determines how the entity acts, and some functions can be very useful.\n\n    On top of having different functions, Qi Entities can have physical protrusions called \"links\".  These Links can connect to nearby Qi Entities, binding them, and allowing them to influence one another.  Collections of Qi Entites bound together are called Qi Structures.\n    \n    Linking Qi Entities to create structures, combined with setting Qi Entity functions, results in a useful craft called Qi Invocation/Qi Programming, though some older circles still refer to this as \"spellcasting\"/\"enchanting\" or simply \"magic\".\u0000css\n    A Qi Entity, given time, will naturally dissipate and cease to exist as the charged, energy-baring particles within it either escape or naturally discharge.  Though, Qi Entities manifesting in solids last thousands of times longer than those mainifesting in fluids (such as water or air).  This is thought to be because a Qi Entity in a fluid, which naturally attempts to maintain a spherical shape, is constantly being subjected to small currents which whisk off a small amount of qi-containing material.  For example, if a Qi Entity was created and manifested in air, it would be pushed around the environment by air currents.  But this is not what causes the energy loss; the loss is caused by fluid currents within the entity pushing Qi-manifested material out of the sphere (therefore discharging the particles and losing the energy) and pulling non-Qi-containing material into the entity's sphere.  Eventually, this causes a total loss of energy in the entity, causing it to dissolve.  Entities manifesting in solids do not have this problem (more accurately, the extent to which they have this problem is negligable).  Instead, Qi Entities in solids dissipate through the natural decay of the charged Qi particles within them (into uncharged Qi particles).\n    \n    Since Qi entities are a component of all known human species' anatomies, most people can produce a programmable Qi Entity from their own body.  These Qi Entities can be reprogrammed to perform a function different than the one it performed while in their body.  They can then be used to make complex Qi Structures.  Though, the act of pulling a Qi Entity out of one's own body is a difficult skill to learn, as it's not something humans are supposed to naturally do.  Despite this, some people spend years of their lives studying and training themselves to be able to extract Qi Entities from thier bodies so that they can perform Qi Invocation without the assistance of a tool.",
